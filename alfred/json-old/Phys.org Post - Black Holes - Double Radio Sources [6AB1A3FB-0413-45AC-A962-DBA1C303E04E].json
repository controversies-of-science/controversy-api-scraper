I - Double radio galaxies, quasars, and extragalactic jets\" by Anthony Peratt\n\n\"The existence of double radio galaxies presents a major challenge to cosmological theories ... Cygnus A, the brightest radio source in the constellation Cygnus, has proved to be the 'prototype' of double radio galaxies, and models of double radio galaxies are usually based on the characteristics of this source ... regardless of whatever ingredients are postulated as necessary in models used to 'explain' their existence, what is observed from any radio source is synchrotron radiation, which requires only the presence of relativistic electrons in a magnetic field.\"",
