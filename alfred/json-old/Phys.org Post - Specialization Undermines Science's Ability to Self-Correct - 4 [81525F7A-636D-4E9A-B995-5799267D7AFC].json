This is that micro-specialization is about micro-validation -- which can neither detect nor correct gross errors in its basic suppositions.\n\nIn the world of micro-specialization that is a modern scientific career, each specialist's attention is focused on technical minutiae and the application of conventional proxy measures and operational definitions.
