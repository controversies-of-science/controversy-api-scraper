    "snippet" : "\"It has often been said that 99% of the matter in the universe is in the plasma state ... This estimate may not be very accurate, but it is certainly a reasonable one in view of the fact that stellar interiors & atmospheres, gaseous nebulae, & much of the interstellar hydrogen are plasmas. In our neighborhood, as soon as one leaves the earth's atmosphere, one encounters the plasma comprising the Van Allen radiation belts & the solar wind. On the other hand, in our everyday lives encounters with plasmas are limited to a few examples: the flash of a lightning bolt, the soft glow of the Aurora Borealis, the conducting gas inside a fluorescent tube or neon sign, & the slight amount of ionization in a rocket exhaust. It would seem that we live in the 1% of the universe in which plasmas do not occur naturally.\"\n\n(Introduction to Plasma Physics, at https:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=u8nvAAAAMAAJ&q=99%25+plasma+universe&dq=99%25+plasma+universe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mfirUIu2DLG00QWy9YH4AQ)",
