    "snippet" : "At Least 20% of the Solar Wind's Acceleration Must Be Deposited Beyond Two Solar Radii from the Sun\n\nJourney from the Center of the Sun\nJack B. Zirker\n(p215-217\n\n\"In order to reach a wind speed of 800 km\/s, a Parker model would require a coronal hole temperature of about 3 million kelvin.  When new observations of coronal holes became available during the flight of Skylab, astronomers received a rude shock.  The holes were cooler than the streamers by as much as a million kelvin.  A typical hole temperature is about 1.4 million kelvin, much smaller than the 3 million a Parker model needs to explain the high wind speed.  What was even more puzzling was that the flux of kinetic energy carried in a wind stream was at least two to three times larger than any wind previously known.  How could a fast stream achieve its ultimate speed? ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
