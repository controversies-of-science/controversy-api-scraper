    "snippet" : "Why Neutron Stars are Impossible\n\nDon Scott\nhttp:\/\/www.electric-cosmos.org\/hrdiagr.htm\n\n\"The concept of the 'neutron star' was a baseless invention. It was proposed because only such a dense material could make up a star that could stand those outrageously high rotation speeds.\n\nBut, one of the basic rules of nuclear chemistry is the 'zone of stability'. This is the observation that if we add neutrons to the nucleus of any atom, we need to add an almost proportional number of protons (and their accompanying electrons) to maintain a stable nucleus. In fact, it seems that when we consider all the natural elements (and the heavy man made elements as well), there is a requirement that in order to hold a group of neutrons together in a nucleus, a certain number of proton-electron pairs are required ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
