    "snippet" : "It seems that you have a very true heart and a strong conviction that something very bad is happening. I actually feel your concern in what you write.\n\nWhat I am trying to tell you, because I've met many people who have made these mistakes, is that science is a very deep subject. There are some unexpected things happening at the meta level of analysis that do not exactly conform to the dominant narratives.\n\nThere are academic whistleblowers. There are critics of science. And there are many, many scientific controversies.\n\nWhen observed together, certain patterns become clear ... I would say obvious.\n\nThe narrative is always about former controversies. People have this impression that there are no ongoing scientific controversies.\n\nIt's wrong. There are many challenges to textbook theory, and the climate change debate fits the mold of those other controversies.\n\nIf you were watching all of them, you would see this.\n\nBut, you're not.ï»¿",
