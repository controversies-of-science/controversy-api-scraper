    "snippet" : "Fabulous Science Fact and Fiction in the History of Scientific Discovery\nJohn Waller\n(p24)\n\n\"The phenomenon of scientists rejecting counter-evidence on the basis that the experiment had been performed incorrectly has been dubbed ‘experimenter’s regress’; it is especially common in fields where new ideas are being supported by new, untried, and difficult-to-use experimental apparatus. Experimenters often have no real way of knowing whether a failure to replicate a result obtained by another team reflects experimental errors on their part or on the part of the original investigators. Indeed, both factors may be at work.\"",
