    "snippet" : "\"Because a plasma (partly) consists of free charges, it is a conductor.  Moving electric charges are currents.  These currents induce magnetic fields which in turn influence the motion of the very particles forming the field-generating currents.  Thus the particle motion in a plasma is not only controlled by external electric and magnetic fields, but also creates fields which add to the external ones and modify the motion of the particles: a plasma can interact with itself. Consequently, dynamics in a plasma are more complex than in a neutral gas. This is most obvious in the large number of different types of plasma waves ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
