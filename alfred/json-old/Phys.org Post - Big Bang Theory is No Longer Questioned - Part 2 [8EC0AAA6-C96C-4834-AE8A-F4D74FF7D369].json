We just need to fill in the gaps,' and Peebles recently was quoted as saying, 'By being a little more clever in the invention of theories a person can find a way around the problems and continue to look for a way to build within the Big Bang framework.'  Apparently [Big Bang]ers have no intention of mending their ways; in the future they will merely employ more cleverness in finding support for [Big Bang Theory].\"",
