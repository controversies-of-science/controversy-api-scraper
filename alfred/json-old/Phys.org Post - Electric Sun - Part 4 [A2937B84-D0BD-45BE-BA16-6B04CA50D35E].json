    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"(Coronal discharges can sometimes be seen as a glow surrounding high-voltage transmission wires, where the wire discharges into the surrounding air). This virtual cathode lies far beyond the planets. In the lexicon of astronomy, this is the 'heliopause.' In electrical terms, it is the cellular sheath or 'double layer' separating the plasma cell that surrounds the Sun ('heliosphere') from the enveloping galactic plasma.\n\nIn an electric universe, such cellular forms are expected between regions of dissimilar plasma properties. According to the glow discharge model of the Sun, almost the entire voltage difference between the Sun and its galactic environment occurs across the thin boundary sheath of the heliopause. Inside the heliopause there is a weak but constant radial electrical field centered on the Sun ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
