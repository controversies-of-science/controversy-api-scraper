That is, under the assumption that this polarization arises from dust grains aligned by either paramagnetic inclusions or radiative torques, the field lines pass over the filament perpendicular to its axis. See their Fig. 1. Subsequent observations confirm these results (Poidevin et al. 2010, 2011). See also Pillai et al. (2015) for dust polarization examples in more distant and massive clouds ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
