In March of 2005, a worldwide conference [98] was held on this topic. The organizers said, 'The recent development of astrophysical observations has revealed that the universe and astrophysical objects are much more dynamic than had been thought. They often show flares, bursts, jets, and high-energy particles, and most of them are more or less related to magnetic reconnection.'\"\n\n[98] US-Japan Workshop on Magnetic Reconnection, Plasma Merging, and Magnetic Jets, \"Astrophysical Reconnection and Particle Acceleration,\" Awaji-shima Island, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, 8-10 March 2005\n",
