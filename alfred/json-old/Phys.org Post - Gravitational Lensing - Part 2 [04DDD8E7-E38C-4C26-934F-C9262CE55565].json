The sudden revival of gravitational lensing to the huge industry it is today is simply due to the quasars. In the 1960's and 70's I started finding high densities of quasars concentrated around nearby, low-redshift galaxies. Because of their high redshifts, it was felt that they could not be associated with low-redshift galaxies ...\n\nThe Einstein Cross ...\n\n... When it was first discovered it caused a panic because it was essentially a high redshift quasar in the nucleus of a low redshift galaxy ... Gravitational galaxy lensing had to be invoked for this one ...\n\n'We put the slit of the spectrograph between quasars A and B in the Einstein Cross and we registered a broad Lyman alpha emission in each quasar. But between them we found a narrow Lyman alpha line -- it looks like there is some low density gas at the same redshift as the quasars between them.' ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
