He [Peter Higgs, of the University of Edinburgh] starts with assuming the existence of a particle that has only mass and no other characteristic, such as charge. So the Higgs particle is like no other in our experience since all normal matter is composed of electric charges that respond to electromagnetic influences (Dark Matter falls into this same category).  However, observe that the mass of a charged subatomic particle is affected by the application of electromagnetic forces ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
