On one hand, inordinate value was attached to photographs that approximated Einstein’s 1.7 seconds of arc deflection; on the other, dubious ad hoc reasons were invented for jettisoning any that disagreed. ‘Einstein’s prediction had not been verified as decisively as was once believed’, Sciama gently pointed out in 1972. Reflecting on eclipse expeditions in general, he added, ‘one might suspect that if the observers did not know what value they were “supposed” to obtain, their published results might vary over a greater range than they actually do’. Or, as the Polish-American physicist Ludwik Silberstein said at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1919, ‘If we had not the prejudice of Einstein’s theory we should not say that the figures strongly indicated a radial law of displacement’ ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
