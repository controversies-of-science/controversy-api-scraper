This confounded the other 114 mission scientists, for it flew in the face of their theories about the formation of the planets ...\n\nArgon‐36 is one of the gases that was present in the solar nebula, the great envelope of matter out of which the sun and the planets were born some 4.6 billion years ago. It is a volatile element, one that is easily boiled off.
