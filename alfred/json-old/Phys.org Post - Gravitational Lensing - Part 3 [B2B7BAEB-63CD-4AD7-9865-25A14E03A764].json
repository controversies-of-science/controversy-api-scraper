The point was, of course, that a line between quasar A and B passed directly between the nucleus of the galaxy and quasar D. On the face of it high redshift gas was indicated near the nucleus of the low redshift galaxy. But what I knew, and what anyone can know looking at the Lyman alpha centered photograph in Color Plate 7-7, is that there is a putative Lyman alpha filament connecting quasar D to the galaxy nucleus. What the spectrum had confirmed was that this indeed was a low density, excited hydrogen filament connecting the two objects of vastly different redshift.\"\n\nNow that Halton Arp is dead, who will check to see if there is any high-redshift material out of place in these images?\n\nThe 200-inch telescope was taken over by Caltech in 1980, and they have since allotted time only to confirmatory observations.",
