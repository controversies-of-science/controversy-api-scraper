    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... A few years later, I began to think that the plasma focus provides a model for another cosmic phenomenon -- quasars. Over hundreds of thousands of years quasars radiate ten thousand times more energy than an average galaxy of a hundred billion stars, yet appear to be no more than a light-year or so across, compared with a galaxy's hundred thousand light-years. Their power density (power per cubic light-year) is a million trillion times larger than that of a galaxy.\n\nHow can such a small object generate so much energy? Conventional wisdom claims that a black hole is at work, but, among other objections, there are cogent reasons to think that any object massive enough to power a quasar will break apart before it collapses into a black hole. In any case, new observations had raised another mystery ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
