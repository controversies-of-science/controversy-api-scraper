For example, in a patently obvious electromagnetic filament like the Double Helix Nebula, if astronomers had measured a magnetic field which wrapped around it in one azimuthal direction, maybe it would have been much harder for them to ignore its electrical nature. But that's not how electric currents in a minimum energy configuration behave in a plasma.\n\nAs the Lundquist-Scott model demands, a Birkeland Current has a tight radial structure of alternate winding and unwinding magnetic fields. If you visualize for a moment how the magnetic field vectors continually rotate with increasing radial distance, you will realize that, no matter the angle from which you observe the filament, the azimuthal component of the magnetic field always gets almost completely cancelled out, leaving only the background magnetic field in which the field-aligned filament flows.'\"",
