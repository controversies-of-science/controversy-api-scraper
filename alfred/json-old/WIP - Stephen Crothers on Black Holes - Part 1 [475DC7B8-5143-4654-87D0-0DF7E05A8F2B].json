The experts have either not read Schwarzschild's 1916 memoir or have otherwise ignored it. Go here [13] to get Schwarzschild's original paper, in English.

It appears that the experts have not read Hilbert either. Go here [12] to get a copy of Hilbert's erroneous derivation, in English. Hilbert's mistake spawned the black hole and the community of theoretical physicists continues to elaborate on this falsehood, with a hostile shouting down of any and all voices challenging them ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
