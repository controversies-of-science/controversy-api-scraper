Put back into the context in which the originators lived out their lives, many ideas are found to be much less clearly aligned with what we now believe to be true. But we are taught to demand much of our founding fathers. Their having been there at the beginning, pointing the way forward, does not seem to be enough. There is also a tendency to expect them, long after they have entered the grave, to remain in the van of progress, their ideas at least broadly anticipating each new development. What we need to bear in mind is that the past really is another country and most certainly not one of which the present was an inevitable culmination. Therefore my third aim is to encourage contextualization not only in its own right but also as a sovereign remedy to presentism. We need to be committed to understanding the past on its own terms without any reference to ‘what happened next’.\"",
