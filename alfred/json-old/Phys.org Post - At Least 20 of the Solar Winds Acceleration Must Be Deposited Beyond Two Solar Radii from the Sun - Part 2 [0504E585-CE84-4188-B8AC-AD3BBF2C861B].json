    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... The answer seems to be some form of extended heating or acceleration in a wind stream.  Parker had assumed for simplicity that all the energy in the wind is deposited at some low height in the corona and that heat conduction spreads this energy outward to maintain the flow.  The new results on wind streams demand some additional mechanism to continue to heat (or push) the wind, far from the sun.\n\nAll the usual mechanisms to heat active regions were reexamined to see whether any could apply to the fast wind streams.  Parker's nanoflare mechanism would not work because it requires closed field lines to store magnetic energy, whereas the field in the wind streams is open.  Only Alfven waves offered any hope ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
