Bruce, of the Electrical Research Association in England, offered a new perspective on the Sun. An electrical researcher, astronomer, and expert on the effects of lightning, Bruce proposed in 1944 that the Sun’s 'photosphere has the appearance, the temperature and the spectrum of an electric arc; it has arc characteristics because it is an electric arc, or a large number of arcs in parallel.' This discharge characteristic, he claimed, 'accounts for the observed granulation of the solar surface.' Bruce’s model, however, was based on a conventional understanding of atmospheric lightning, allowing him to envision the 'electric' Sun without reference to external electric fields.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
