All inflationary predictions depend on the assumed form of the inflation potential [energy], not yet derivable from fundamental theory.  Simple models include an arbitrary potential, which must [then] be fine-tuned to obtain agreement with observation.  Worse, they are quantum mechanically inconsistent (non-renormalizable) beyond leading order when gravity is included. At best, the models are a 'stand in' effect theory for a fundamental approach still to be developed ... The strongest argument for inflation is just that there is no other viable alternative ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
