In this view, the charge differential at the Earth’s distance from the Sun is smaller than our present ability to measure—perhaps one or two electrons per cubic meter. But the charge density is far higher closer to the Sun, and at the solar corona and surface the electric field is of sufficient strength to generate all of the energetic phenomena we observe ...\n\nSunspots, prominences, coronal mass ejections, and a host of other features require ever more complicated guesswork on behalf of the fusion model. But this is the way an anode in a coronal glow discharge behaves!\n\nIn the electrical model, the Sun is the 'anode' or positively charged body in the electrical exchange, while the 'cathode' or negatively charged contributor is not a discrete object, but the invisible 'virtual cathode' at the limit of the Sun’s coronal discharge ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
