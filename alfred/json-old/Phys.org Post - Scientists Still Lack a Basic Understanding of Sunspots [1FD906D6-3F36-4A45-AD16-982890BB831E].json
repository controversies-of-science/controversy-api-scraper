Zirker\n(p162)\n\n\"Sunspots have been studied intensively ever since Hale's discovery of their basic magnetic character, in the early 1900s, and yet we are still far from a thorough understanding of their structure and evolution.  We don't even have a good explanation for the fact that they have an umbra and a penumbra.  How are they heated?  How do they die?  What do they look like underneath the photosphere?\n\nOne would think that better observations, with sharper detail, would help to answer the kinds of questions everyone raises, but as observations have improved, a flock of new puzzles has appeared.\"",
