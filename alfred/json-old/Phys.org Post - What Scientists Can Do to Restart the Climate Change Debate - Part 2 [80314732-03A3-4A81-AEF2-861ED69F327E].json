    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... We want to know how well the models work. That is, how well each forecast if run with a correct scenario ...\n\nA massive body of research describes how to validate climate models (see below), most stating that they must use 'hindcasts' (predicting the past) because we do not know the temperature of future decades. Few sensible people trust hindcasts, with their ability to be (even inadvertently) tuned to work (that's why scientists use double-blind testing for drugs where possible) ...\n\nBut now we know the future — the future of models run in past IPCC reports — and can test their predictive ability ...\n\nClimate scientists can run such tests today for global surface temperatures ...\n\nSo they should run the models as they were originally run for the IPCC in the First Assessment Report (FAR, 1990), in the Second (SAR, 1995), and the Third (TAR, 2001) ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
