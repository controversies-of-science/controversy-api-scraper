If one goes outside the earth, however, the plasma state is the most abundant state of matter. It is thought that more than 99.9% of matter in the universe is in plasma.  Indeed, plasmic matter begins at about 50km above the earth's surface in the ionosphere.  There are various types of plasmas in the universe, ranging from very high density (n ~ 10^36\/m^3) inside a white dwarf to very low density (n ~ 10^6\/m^3) in interstellar space.\"",
