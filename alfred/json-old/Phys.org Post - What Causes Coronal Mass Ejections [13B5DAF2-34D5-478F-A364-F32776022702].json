Zirker\n(p4)\n\n\"We've already mentioned the masses of hot gas that the sun shoots off now and then toward the earth, like the one that zapped Quebec.  These are not part of the steady solar wind, but they also originate in the corona and are called 'coronal mass ejections.'  We still have rather fuzzy ideas on how such mass is expelled from the sun (another big question) and clearly we would like to be able to predict such events in advance.\"\n\n(and from p205 ...)\n\n\"Although astronomers have obtained a lot of new satellite observations of CMEs, the physical cause of these dramatic events is still being debated.\"",
