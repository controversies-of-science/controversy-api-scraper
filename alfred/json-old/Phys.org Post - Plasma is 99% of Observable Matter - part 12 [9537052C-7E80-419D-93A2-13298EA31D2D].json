A sunspot is a sharply bordered volume of cool gas embedded in the hot solar photosphere; but it stays stable for several months prevented by strong magnetic fields from warming or mixing with its environment.  A cold and dense volume of gas or liquid in a hot environment sinks.  A solar filament is cold and dense compared with the ambient corona but it is held in position against gravity by strong magnetic fields. Such discrepencies between our daily experience and the behavior of ionized gases clearly show that plasmas do not form a significant part of our environment. Why then do we study such exotic phenomena?  Are there applications for plasmas? ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
