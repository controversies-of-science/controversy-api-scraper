    "snippet" : "An Electrical Engineer's Take on 'Magnetic Reconnection'\nJune 7, 2016\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/ILUmJmDi6uM?t=324\n\n\"A more credible explanation for the release of matter and energy from the Sun is that this occurs when coronal loops break explosively -- that is due to avalanche breakdown in double layers within the path of the electric current which forms the loop. We've all seen pictures of these marvelous magnetic loops. You're seeing only plasma.  In those pictures, you're not seeing the magnetic field; you're seeing excited electrically excited plasma.  When that electric current breaks, the loop disappears, the magnetic field disappears and the previously stored magnetic energy is released out into space along with the plasma matter that formed the loop.  And that of course includes electrons that the MMS project is trying to measure.  But, it's just that simple.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
