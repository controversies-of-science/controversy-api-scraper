At that time he started looking for an extragalactic object which might be directly behind another, and thus have its outer light rays bent inward by the gravitational field of the foreground object so that it formed a ring or halo. Some 'ring galaxies' were found, but they all seemed to be physical rings around the galaxy and not magnified background objects.\n\nThe more common situation to be expected was when the background object was not exactly centered and the gravitational ring collapsed into a one sided arc ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
