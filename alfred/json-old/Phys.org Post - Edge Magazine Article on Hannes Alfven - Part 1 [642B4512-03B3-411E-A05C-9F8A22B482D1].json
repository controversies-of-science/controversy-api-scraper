    "snippet" : "The Plasma Universe of Hannes Alfven\nDavid Talbott\n\nhttp:\/\/coincider.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/edgescience-09.pdf\n\n\"Alfvén's interest in magnetic fields laid the foundations of today's magnetohydrodynamic theory, a theory widely employed by astrophysicists. In the original formulations of the theory, Alfvén spoke of magnetic fields being \"frozen\" into neutral plasma, and the magnetohydrodynamic equations he formulated implied that the electric currents that create magnetic fields could be effectively ignored. Hence, the plasma activity on the Sun and in more remote space could be analyzed without reference to any larger domain of electric currents or electric circuits ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
