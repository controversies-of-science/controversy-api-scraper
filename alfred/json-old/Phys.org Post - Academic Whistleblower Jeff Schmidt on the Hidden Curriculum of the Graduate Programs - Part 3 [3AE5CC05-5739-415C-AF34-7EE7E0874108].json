Because they internalize both the paradigms and their employers' priorities and values, scientists, at least in their own eyes, are completely nonpartisan in their work: They don't 'get political.'  They don't think about, let alone challenge, the ideology built into their techniques.  Contrary to popular images of scientists as challengers of established beliefs (like Galileo or Einstein), the vast majority of scientists never seek to test their paradigms and do not participate in paradigm disputes.  They don't waste their employers' coin by getting caught up in efforts to overthrow existing worldviews or to establish new ones.
