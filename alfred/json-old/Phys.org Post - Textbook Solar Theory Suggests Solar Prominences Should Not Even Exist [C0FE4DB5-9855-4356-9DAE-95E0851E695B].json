They are a hundred times cooler than the corona (with temperatures below 10,000 K) and a hudred times denser.  This cool, dense mass appears to hang suspended in the tenuous corona and would certainly collapse if it were not supported somehow.  The best guess these days is that magnetic fields in the cavity form a kind of cradle in which the prominence mass lies.\"",
