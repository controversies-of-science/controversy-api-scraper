    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... The problem with this discovery is that its voltage was calculated not from one experiment but from the combined evidence of two experiments. This is not the way science operates, as physicist Aiden Randle-Conde explains:\n\n'Why shouldn't we combine Higgs searches across experiments?\n\nIf neither experiment gets 5 sigma [the level at which this experiment should be confirmed] and we would like a discovery, what can be done?  The next obvious step would be to combine the results from the two experiments and count the Sigma [value of both together]. Despite being an obvious next step, this is the worst thing we can do at the moment ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
