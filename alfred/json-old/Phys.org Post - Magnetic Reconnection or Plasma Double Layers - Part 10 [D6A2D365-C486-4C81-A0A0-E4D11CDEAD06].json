In spite of all this, we have witnessed at the same time an enormously voluminous formalism building up based on this obviously erroneous concept.  Indeed, we have been burdened with a gigantic pseudoscience which penetrates large parts of cosmic plasma physics.\n\nI was naive enough to believe that such a pseudoscience would die by itself in the scientific community, and I concentrated my work on more pleasant problems.  To my great surprise the opposite has occurred: the 'merging' pseudoscience seems to be increasingly powerful. Magnetospheric physics and solar wind physics today are no doubt in a chaotic state, and a major reason for this is that part of the published papers are science and part pseudoscience, perhaps even with a majority in the latter group.' ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
