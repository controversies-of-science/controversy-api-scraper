    "snippet" : "The Virtue of Heresy: Confessions of a Dissident Astronomer\n(p250, 2008)\n\n\"The progress of astrophysics has been hobbled by a myopic inability to see across the fences separating various scientific disciplines.  I firmly believe that most astronomers cling to highly unlikely gas models for the Sun and other stars simply because of their ignorance of the nuances of nuclear chemistry.  The tracks of nuclides leave no doubt in the minds of those with the requisite skills to read them.  The odd chemistry credit obtained along the way to a degree in physics is simply insufficient to equip astronomers to see the detail.  This is pointedly clear also in our lack of depth in electrical field theory and experimental plasma dynamics.  A bit of training in these disciplines and we begin to see the universe in a whole new light.\"",
