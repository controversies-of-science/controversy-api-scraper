In particular, it may explain the preponderance of neutral hydrogen in thread-like structures throughout the galaxy that have been detected by radio telescopes.\"\n\nAnother consequence of these circling charged particles which can be worked out from geometry alone is that they will induce both a long-range attraction AND short-range repulsion between parallel filaments.  Thus, two-ness is a common feature of plasma filamentation because like the filament itself, it is also a self-stable structure.\n\nWhat that implies is that the EMF can be extended to INFINITE DISTANCES.",
