Eddington’s Principe team was hampered by cloud cover and took away just 16 plates, but only two of these, each showing only five stars, were actually usable. The Sobral team managed to take the clearest photographs with its 4-inch telescope. These suggested a deflection of star beams grazing the Sun at between 1.86 and 2.1 seconds of arc, averaging out at 1.98 seconds. (Note that Einstein’s prediction was 1.7 seconds) ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
