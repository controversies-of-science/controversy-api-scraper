    "snippet" : "What I believe sometimes happens in the sciences is that the mistakes we have in textbook theory can sometimes create these big important questions.\n\nDr. Gerald Pollack points to a mistake in the biological sciences which goes to the essence of what we are.\n\nHe argues that the textbook theory for life developed with a mistaken notion at its heart: that cell membranes are like sacks which contain the innards -- similar to a balloon filled with water.\n\nAs biology matured, it became apparent that cells are actually more gel-like.\n\nThat is a very significant observation because gels come with all sorts of functionality built into them -- functionality which the textbook theories never thought was there.\n\nWhen you fix this problem in the biological sciences, it significantly alters these discussions about the origin for life.\n\nIf you want to know how life originated, I recommend you learn Pollack's gel cell hypothesis here ...\n\n*Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life*\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Cells-Gels-Engines-Gerald-Pollack\/dp\/0962689521\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489879291&sr=8-1&keywords=cells%2C+gels+and+the+engines+of+life\n\nThen read this paper ...\n\n*Hypothesis: the origin of life in a hydrogel environment*\nJack T.
