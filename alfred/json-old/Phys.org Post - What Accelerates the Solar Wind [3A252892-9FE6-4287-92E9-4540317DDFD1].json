    "snippet" : "Solar Mystery: What Accelerates the Solar 'Wind'?\n\nJourney from the Center of the Sun\nJack B. Zirker\n(p3-4)\n\n\"A second big question concerns the solar wind.  We know that the corona boils steadily off into space as a solar 'wind' that flows around the earth at speeds as high as 800 km\/s.  This gusty wind produces auroras and so-called geomagnetic storms, events in which the earth's magnetic field takes a terrific buffeting.  These storms interrupt radio communications, among other nasty effects.  Although the solar wind has been studied intensively, especially from spacecraft, we still don't know how it's being accelerated to such high speeds.  Again, several competing ideas have been proposed and are being followed up.\"",
