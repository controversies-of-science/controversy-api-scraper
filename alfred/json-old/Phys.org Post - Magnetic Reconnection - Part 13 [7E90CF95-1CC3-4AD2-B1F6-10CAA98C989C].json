    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\nAlfven remarked [97].\n\n'From the point of view of the traditional theoretical physicist, a plasma looks immensely complicated. We may express this by saying that when, by an immense number of vectors and tensors and integral equations, theoreticians have prescribed what a plasma MUST do, the plasma, like a naughty child, refuses to obey.  The reason is either that the plasma is so silly that it does not understand the sophisticated mathematics, or it is that the plasma is so clever that it finds other ways of behaving, ways which the theoreticians were not clever enough to anticipate.'\"\n\n[97] \"Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics,\" H. Alfven, IEEE Trans. on Plasma Sci., PS-14, No.6, Dec 1986.\n\n(cont'd)",
