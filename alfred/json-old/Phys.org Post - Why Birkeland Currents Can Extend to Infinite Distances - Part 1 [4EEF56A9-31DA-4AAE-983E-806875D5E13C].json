The movement of charged particles in these magnetic fields, also results in the particle creating its own magnetic field.\n\nThe further away a particle is from the central axis â€“ the more circular its path. The helical rotation outward from the axial current creates further electromagnetic forces that contribute to the stability of the Birkeland Current. Birkeland Currents almost always occur in pairs. Currents that often spiral and twist around each other ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
