The remarkable result reported by Mozer et al. is that streams of 7000 double layers were observed in one minute: it was like ascending a stairway of 7000 steps very quickly. Each double layer is detected as an electric field spike of a typical duration of 0.45 milliseconds and a potential step of about 30 volts.\"\n\n\"Why Space Physics Needs to Go Beyond the MHD Box\", George K Parks, Space Science Reviews, 2004\n\n\"A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as double layers, critical velocity, pinch effects, and circuits [all electrodynamic plasma concepts] is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century (e.g., double layers, Langmuir, 1929; pinch effect, Bennet, 1934).\"",
