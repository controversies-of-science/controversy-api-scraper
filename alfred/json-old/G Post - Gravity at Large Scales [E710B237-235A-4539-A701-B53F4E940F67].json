    "snippet" : "Quote from _Bankrupting Physics: How Today's Top Scientists Are Gambling Away Their Credibility_, by Alexander Unzicker and Sheilla Jones (2013), p10:\n\n_\"Combing through the library, I found a well-known textbook on galactic dynamics where the authors state:_\n\n_'It is worth remembering that all of the discussion so far has been based on the premise that Newtonian gravity and general relativity are correct on large scales. *In fact, there is little or no direct evidence that conventional theories of gravity are correct on scales much larger than a light year or so.* Newtonian gravity works extremely well on scales of 10^12 meters, the solar system (...) *It is principally the elegance of general relativity and its success in solar system tests that lead us to the bold extrapolation to scales 10^19 - 10^24 meters* ... [3]'_\n\n_Wow!  Fancy that.  Two leading experts claim that the law of gravity has been well tested in our solar system only -- a tiny fraction of the universe that corresponds to a single snowflake in all of Greenland. *Scientists seem drawn to the 'elegance' of the theory, which is not really a scientific criterion. I often confront physicists and astronomers with this quote.  Usually they shrug and reply airily, 'That is indeed true, but why shouldn't the law of gravity be valid? So far, there is nothing better to replace it.'\"*_\n\n[3] J. Binney and S. Tremaine, S. _Galactic Dynamics_ (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008), 635.",
