    "snippet" : "Richard A. Kerr, \"Venus: Not Simple of Familiar, But Interesting,\" Science, Vol. 207 (1980), p. 289\n\n\"The question concerns how the sun's energy behaves once it penetrates the highest clouds. When Pioneer Venus's probes looked at the amount of radiant energy passing through the atmosphere, each one found more energy being radiated up from the lower atmosphere than enters it as sunlight.  At first blush, it would seem that the atmosphere violates the laws of thermodynamics by transferring heat energy from the cool clouds to the hot lower atmosphere, from which it is then radiated.  To further complicate the situation, the size of the apparent upward flow of energy varies from place to place by a factor of 2, which was a disturbing discovery about a planet thought to be relatively uniform ...\n\nThe much bally-hooed greenhouse effect of Venus's carbon dioxide atmosphere can account for only part of the heating, and evidence for other heating mechanisms is now in a turmoil.\"",
