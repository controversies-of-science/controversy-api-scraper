    "snippet" : "\"Persons educated with the greatest intensity we know can no longer communicate with each other on the plane of their major intellectual concern. This is serious for our creative, intellectual and, above all, our normal life. It is leading us to interpret the past wrongly, to misjudge the present, and to deny our hopes of the future. It is making it difficult or impossible for us to take good action.\"\n\n- C. P. Snow, 'The Two Cultures: A Second Look', Times Literary Supplement, 1963",
