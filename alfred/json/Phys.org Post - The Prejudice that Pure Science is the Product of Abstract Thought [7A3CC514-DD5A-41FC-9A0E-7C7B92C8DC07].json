    "snippet" : "Einstein and the Big Bang\n\n\"In recent decades the prejudice has become deeply rooted that 'pure' science, especially theoretical physics is the product of abstract thought and mathematical deduction alone. As Eric Lerner points out, Einstein was partly responsible for this tendency. Unlike earlier theories, such as Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism, or Newton's laws of gravity, which were firmly based on experiment, and soon confirmed by hundreds of thousands of independent observations, Einstein's theories were initially confirmed on the basis of only two -- the deflection of starlight by the sun's gravitational field and a slight deviation in the orbit of Mercury.\"",
