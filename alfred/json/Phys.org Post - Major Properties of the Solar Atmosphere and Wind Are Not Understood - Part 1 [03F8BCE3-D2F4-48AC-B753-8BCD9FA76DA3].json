Hady, eds., 2006\n\n\"Major properties of the solar atmosphere and wind are not understood. The energy distribution of the solar atmosphere perturbations, over nearly ten orders of magnitude in energy, is close (within one order of magnitude) to a power-law of index -2, even though there is no agreement on the detailed shape. There is no agreed explanation of the origin of the solar wind, either, nor of the fact that the total wind energy flux is independent of speed, latitude, and phase of solar cycle, with an average base flux of 70 W\/m2 -- a figure that is similar for a number of other cool stellar winds, and is close to the total observed energy flux of solar atmosphere perturbations ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
