Peratt, Astrophysics and Space Science 227: 167-73, 1995\n\n\"Marklund (1979) found a stationary state when the inward convections of ions and electrons toward the axis of a filament was matched by recombination and outward diffusion of the neutralized plasma (Figure 1). The equilibrium density of the ionized component normally has a maximum at the axis. However, because of the radiated loss of energy, the filament cools and a temperature gradient is associated with the plasma. Because of this hollow cylinders, or modifications of hollow cylinders of matter, will form about the flux tubes.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
