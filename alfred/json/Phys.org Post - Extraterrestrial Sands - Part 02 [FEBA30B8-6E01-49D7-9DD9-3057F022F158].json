We would therefore expect to see solid physical evidence of masses of sand emanating from this location -- a clear directional and quantitative source pattern with clear definitive and defining features. We don't see this ...\"\n\np25:\n\n\"Nubian Sandstone underlies an extensive area of Egypt. In addition to the outcrops some believe such deposits may have also participated in the production of Saharan sand. This is puzzling, for how could rain possibly erode away 'underlying' sandstone? Any underlying sandstone would have been naturally shielded from erosion by overlying sand, exactly as it is today ...\"\n\np26:\n\n\"A contributing factor in siltation would be the tons of mud and organic material washed off the once fertile land.
