There clearly has to be some impressive cancellation, but why should this be so precise that it leads to a row of 119 zeros after the decimal point, but not 120 or more?\n\nA slightly different theory speculates that the repulsion is not actually due to empty space (the vacuum), but that there is some all-pervasive fluid that has negative pressure and therefore exerts a gravitational repulsion, but which dilutes and decays during the expansion, so that by now it is guaranteed to be very small.
