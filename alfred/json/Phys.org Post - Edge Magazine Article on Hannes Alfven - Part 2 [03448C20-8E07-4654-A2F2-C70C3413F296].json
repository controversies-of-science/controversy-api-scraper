    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"To this notion astronomers were readily attracted, and for a time they thought they had an ally in the brilliant electrical engineer. Although his \"fundamental work and discoveries in magnetohydrodynamics\" led to his Nobel Prize in 1970, the background to this occasion is paradoxical.\n\nThrough much of the 19th and 20th century, most astronomers and cosmologists had assumed the \"vacuum\" of space would not permit electric currents. Later, when it was discovered that all of space is a sea of electrically conductive plasma, the theorists reversed their position, asserting that any charge separation would be immediately neutralized. Here they found what they were looking for in Alfvén's frozen-in magnetic fields and in his magnetohydrodynamic equations. Electric currents could then be viewed as strictly localized and temporary phenomena — needed just long enough to create a magnetic field, to magnetize plasma, a virtually \"perfect\" conductor.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
