    "snippet" : "\"In an oversimplified presentation, the method Einstein used in the creation of his theory of relativity can be reduced to the following simple rules:\n\n1.  Introduce a false axiom (the postulate of constancy of the speed of light).\n\n2.  Draw on all the miracles (time dilation, length contraction, conversion of time into space, conversion of space into time etc.) the false axiom produces and become god-like.\n\n3.  In the capacity of a god, do all necessary tricks so as to hide all dangerous inconsistencies generated by the false axiom.\"\n\n- Albert Einstein: The Lucky Juggler, Pentcho Valev",
