Rantsev-Kartinov\n\n\"A detailed analysis of micro- and nanostructure of various carbonaceous and hydrocarbonaceous films and agglomerates, deposited on the surface of vacuum chamber and special collectors inside the chamber in tokamak T-10, carried out in [1-4], revealed the identity of its topological structuring to that of the following structures: coaxial tubular blocks, sometimes with radial spokes, and cartwheel-like structures as a separate block on its own axle or that in the but-end of the tubule. That analysis has continued ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
