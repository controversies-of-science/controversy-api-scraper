    "snippet" : "\"To say that the victory of science was the victory of skepticism is misleading, however. If science had been merely skeptical, it would have merely replaced belief with disbelief. This it didn't do; science gave new grounds for knowledge that belief couldn't match. To disdainfully dismiss any immaterial phenomenon, as skeptics do, actually betrays the scientific method, which allows any hypothesis into argument in an open-minded tolerance for the next ridiculous speculation that may turn out to be true.\"\n\n- Deepak Chopra, The Downside of Skepticism: Gadflies Without a Sting",
