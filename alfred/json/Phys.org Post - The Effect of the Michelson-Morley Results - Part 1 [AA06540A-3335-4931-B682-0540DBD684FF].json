    "snippet" : "\"In 1887 the Michelson-Morley experiment dropped a bombshell into physical theory by demonstrating that the foregoing rule as to the composition of relative velocities does not apply to the velocity of light, and that the measured value of this velocity is constant irrespective of the reference system. By this time, nearly a hundred years later, the sensational impact of the findings of this experiment is beginning to grow somewhat dim, and there is an increasing tendency to minimize its importance in the development of present-day physical theory, even to the extent, in some cases, of contending that Einstein was not appreciably influenced by the experiment in formulating his theories ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
