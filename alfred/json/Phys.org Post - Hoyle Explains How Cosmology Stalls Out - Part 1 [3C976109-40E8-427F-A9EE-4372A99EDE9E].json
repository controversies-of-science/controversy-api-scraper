Despite what supporters of big-bang cosmology claim, it is not explained. The supposed explanation is nothing but an entry in the gardener's catalogue of hypotheses that constitutes the theory. Had observation given 27 kelvins instead Of 2.7 kelvins for the temperature, then 27 kelvins would have been entered in the catalogue. Or 0.27 kelvin. Or anything at all.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
