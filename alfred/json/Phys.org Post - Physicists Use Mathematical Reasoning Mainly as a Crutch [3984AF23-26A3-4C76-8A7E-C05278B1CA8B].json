Mugler Mathematical Association of America, Washington, 1995, p.275 Reprinted in Am. J. Phys., Vol. 67, No. 12, December 1999, p.1151\n\n\"PHYSICISTS' MATHEMATICS: Physicists use mathematical reasoning mainly as a crutch, either to convince themselves that they are reasoning correctly in complicated situations or to help themselves remember the sequence of steps in an argument. In either case mathematical rigor is irrelevant, and any kind of plausible argument, however dubious logically, will serve. Since the physicists' conclusions are usually known to be true, and will be discarded if they do not check with experiment, little harm is done.\"",
