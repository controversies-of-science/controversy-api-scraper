This must not be dismissed as a humorous wisecrack: Hoyle, and others of his type, really believe that this is so. They were not necessarily born with a deficiency of commonsense: they have exceptional mathematical ability which has been mistaken for exceptional intelligence, and have been so trained that their normal intelligence has expired through desuetude; much mathematics hath made them -- what they are. They are now no more able to perceive the advantages of intelligence than the blind men in H. G. Wells's story could perceive the advantages of sight.\"",
