    "snippet" : "\"Sir James Jeans, one of the founding fathers of the quantum theory, eloquently summarizes this contemporary Primacy of Mathematics attitude:\n\n'[T]he final truth about a phenomenon resides in the mathematical description of it; so long as there is no imperfection in this, our knowledge of the phenomenon is complete. We go beyond the mathematical formula at our own risk; we may find a model or picture which helps us to understand it, but we have no right to expect this, and our failure to find such a model or picture need not indicate that either our reasoning or our knowledge is at fault. The making of models or pictures to explain mathematical formulae and the phenomena they describe is not a step towards, but a step away from reality; it is like making graven images of a spirit.\"\n\n- [Ken Wilbur, ed., Quantum Questions, page 142].
