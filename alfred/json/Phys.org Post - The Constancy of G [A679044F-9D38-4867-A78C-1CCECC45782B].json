    "snippet" : "Harold Aspden, Physics without Einstein, p.176\n\n\"... the thought of 1,000,000,000 tons of matter being compacted into a match-box is really taking liberties with Newton's discovery of the law of gravity. It is bold assumption to imagine that, whatever gravity is, the constant of gravitation, G, will, in fact, remain constant under all conditions. The ideas about gravitational collapse are all suspect until we can explain the reason behind the constancy of G and the limitations on its constancy.\"",
