Probably more than 99 percent of visible matter in the universe exist in the plasma state. Plasmas exist, e.g. as interstellar gas, in stellar atmospheres, inside the sun, in giant planets, and in white dwarfs.\"\n\nhttp:\/\/helios.gsfc.nasa.gov\/qa_cr.html#plasma\n\nNASA's Cosmicopia\nAsk Us: Cosmic Rays, Energetic Particles, and Plasma\n\n\"How was it determined that 99% of the Universe is in a plasma state?\n\nMost of the gas in interstellar space is ionized (astronomers can tell by the wavelengths of light the gas absorbs and emits), and all of the gas in stars [is] ionized, that's where the 99% comes from. The 99% ignores any dark matter which might be out there.\"",
