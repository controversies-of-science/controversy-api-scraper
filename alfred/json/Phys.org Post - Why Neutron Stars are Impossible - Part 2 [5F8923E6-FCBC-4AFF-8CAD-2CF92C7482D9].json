The heavier nuclei contain a few more neutrons than protons, but the limit seems to be 1.5 neutrons per proton. Nuclei that differ significantly from this ratio SPONTANEOUSLY UNDERGO RADIOACTIVE TRANSFORMATIONS that tend to bring their compositions into or closer to this ratio.\n\nFlying in the face of this fact, mainstream astrophysicists continue to postulate the existence of stars made up of solid material consisting only of neutrons, 'Neutronium'. This is yet one more example of Fairie Dust entities fantasized by astrophysicists to explain otherwise inexplicable observations ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
