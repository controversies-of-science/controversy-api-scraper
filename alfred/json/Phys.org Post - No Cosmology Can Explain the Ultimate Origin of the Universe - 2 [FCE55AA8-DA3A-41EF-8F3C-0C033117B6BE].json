[Big Bang Theory] seemed to do that for a time, but neither open, flat, nor one-shot or closed cycling scenarios have escaped the problems of [Big Bang Theory], and the same questions remain ...\n\nNo cosmology can promise knowledge of the 'first cause,' and probably none ever will.  The quest for ultimate answers to the origin of life and the universe is what drives men to science, philosophy and religion.  Apparently a new theory can for a time quiet that longing, but sooner or later we realize that with each hard earned advance in science we have only moved one step closer to the ultimate cause.  We must face the prospect of never reaching an understanding of the infinities of time and space.  (Physicist-philosopher Paul K. Feyerabend has been quoted as saying, 'this one-day fly, a human being, this little bit of nothing discovering the secret of existence is crazy.')\"",
