    "snippet" : "\"A scientific theory cannot be 'denied.' Only a belief can be denied. The person who uses the word 'denier' thus reveals that they hold global warming as a belief, not a scientific theory. Beliefs are the basis of revealed religion. Revelations cannot be corroborated or studied in the laboratory, so religions are based on dogmatic beliefs conservatively held. Religions tend to be closed systems of belief that reject criticism. But the sciences are open systems of knowledge that welcome criticism. I'm a scientist, and therefore I must happily confess to being a denier.\"\n\n- David Deming is a geophysicist, associate professor of arts and sciences at the University of Oklahoma",
