Because a genius grounds his every thought in Ultimate Reality, his thinking is completely unaffected by the values, myths, beliefs, and mores of his culture. He is like a child of God, producing every thought from within himself, dwelling far above the confines of human relativism. His every movement is an expression of eternity. \n\nIn light of this, I wouldn't call Einstein or Bach or Feynman geniuses. While these men had extraordinary talent, their lack of awareness of the nature of Reality meant that their consciousness was not of a very high quality. They still suffered from gross delusions, which, given their advanced intellects, made them appear very foolish. The best historical examples of genius that I can find are Socrates, Diogenes, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Hakuin, Huang Po, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Weininger.\"\n\n- David Quinn",
