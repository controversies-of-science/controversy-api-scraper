In either case, such explanations are no longer sought. This obviously stunts the growth of knowledge, since it makes physicists think they are finished understanding a given phenomenon when in fact they have only begun to describe it. Deep questions, the kind that lead to identification of underlying causes, simply no longer get asked.\"\n\n- Travis Norsen, Mathematics vs. Matter: The Philosophic Roots of the Rejection of Physical Causation in 20th Century Physics.",
