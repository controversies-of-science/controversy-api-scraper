Crocodiles require shallow water, but crocodiles in water that is colder than 65 F tend to sink to the bottom in lassitude and drown as they do in places even like Florida during severe cold weather.\n\nThe scientific establishment, meanwhile, has not been entirely silent when it comes to propositions concerning the solution of the puzzle which the one-time existence of these Arctic forests raise.
