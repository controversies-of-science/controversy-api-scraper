    "snippet" : "\"In the other major 20th century theory in physics -- relativity -- the story is much the same. The physical discovery that led to relativity theory was that the measured speed of light is independent of the state of motion of the source and the detector ... Relativity theory, however, does not explain this surprising and counter-intuitive observation. Instead, it simply works out the consequences when the constancy of the speed of light is taken as a mathematical axiom. The standard view of physicists is that the axiom needs no physical explanation. Rather, it is simply a brute fact which must be accepted and from which additional predictions may be deduced.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
