    "snippet" : "Henri Poincaré, at the conclusion of the preface to his book, 'Hypothéses Cosmogoniques', states:\n\n\"One fact that strikes everyone is the spiral shape of some nebulae; it is encountered much too often for us to believe that it is due to chance. It is easy to understand how incomplete any theory of cosmogony which ignores this fact must be. None of the theories accounts for it satisfactorily, and the explanation I myself once gave, in a kind of toy theory, is no better than the others. Consequently, we come up against a big question mark.\"",
