    "snippet" : "The Invisible Sky, Gerrit Verschuur\n\n\"Anomalous Velocity Hydrogen\n\nNot all is understood about the distribution of HI in the Milky Way. For example, large areas of sky are found to contain HI moving at velocities that are not expected if the gas is confined to the plane of the Galaxy. In particular, when a radio telescope is pointed above or below the galactic plane, only relatively local gas traveling at velocities between Â±20 km\/s with respect to zero, defined in terms of the average random motion of stars near the sun, should be observed. However, HI at very high negative velocities, which indicates motion toward us, is found at high galactic latitudes. These structures are known as high-velocity clouds, although detailed maps of such features show them to be filamentary instead of cloud-like. Their distance and origin continue to be the subject of controversy.\"",
