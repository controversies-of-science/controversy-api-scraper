Typical is near-universal acceptance of the notion of increasing entropy as a fundamental law of the Universe: the idea that the Universe is essentially running down as a whole. This notion was promoted by Kant, Laplace, Clausius, Lord Kelvin and others, as the thesis of a supposedly inevitable 'heat death' of the Universe. And it comes out, for example, in the prevailing 'line' concerning the Crab Nebula, repeated again and again in textbooks and research papers alike: 'You had a star there, it collapsed and exploded. Boom! A supernova explosion. And what was left over after the star blew up, is the Crab Nebula.' Thus, nearly everywhere, in almost ritual fashion, the Crab Nebula is constantly referred to as 'super-nova remnant.' A remnant! Not a process of development.\"",
