[sic] The presence of such a connection would be almost a tragedy for meteorology since it would evidently mean that it would first be necessary to predict solar activity in order to predict the weather; this would greatly postpone the development of scientific methods of weather prediction. Therefore, arguments concerning the presence of such a connection should be viewed most critically.\"",
