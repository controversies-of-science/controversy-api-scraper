Plasmas exist, e.g. as interstellar gas, in stellar atmospheres, inside the sun, in giant planets, and in white dwarfs.\"\n\n(Quantum Statistics of Nonideal Plasmas, at https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?vid=ISBN3540652841&id=wLN69UmwyJsC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=plasma+99%25+universe&sig=DObg7XXvjV_CYCYIAGDnJd_PvDE#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n\"How was it determined that 99% of the Universe is in a plasma state?\n\nMost of the gas in interstellar space is ionized (astronomers can tell by the wavelengths of light the gas absorbs and emits), and all of the gas in stars [is] ionized, that's where the 99% comes from. The 99% ignores any dark matter which might be out there.\"\n\n(NASA's Cosmicopia - Ask Us: Cosmic Rays, Energetic Particles, and Plasma at http:\/\/helios.gsfc.nasa.gov\/qa_cr.html#plasma)",
