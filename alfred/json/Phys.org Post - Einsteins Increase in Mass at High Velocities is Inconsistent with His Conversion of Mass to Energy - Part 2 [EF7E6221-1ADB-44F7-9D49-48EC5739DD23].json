    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... Mass cannot be an accompaniment of kinetic energy, an entity that increases as the kinetic energy increases, as required by the aspect of Einstein's theories that explains the behavior of particles in the accelerators, and also an entity that can be converted to kinetic energy, one that decreases as the kinetic energy increases, as required by the aspect of Einstein's theories that explains the atomic bomb. Both of these aspects of the theories are mathematically correct, so far as we are able to determine at present, but they are mutually contradictory from the conceptual standpoint, and therefore at least one of them is conceptually wrong. The overwhelming mass of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that mass and energy are interconvertible is thus equally overwhelming evidence against the hypothesis that mass increases with velocity.\"\n\n- Dewey B.
