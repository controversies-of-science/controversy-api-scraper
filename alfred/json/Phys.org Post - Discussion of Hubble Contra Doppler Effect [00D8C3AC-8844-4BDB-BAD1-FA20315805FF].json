    "snippet" : "\"Humason assembled spectra of the nebulae and I attempted to estimate distances.\"\n\n- So wrote Hubble of his colleague Milton Humason in 1935, by which time spectra had been obtained for over 150 nebulae. Hubble sternly advised against using the Doppler effect for galaxies and argued against the recessional velocity interpretation of redshift, convincing Robert Millikan, the 1923 recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics and director of physics at the California Institute of Technology, that the redshift interpretation as an expansion of the universe was probably wrong, the year before both of their deaths in 1953.\n\n(sources unknown)",
