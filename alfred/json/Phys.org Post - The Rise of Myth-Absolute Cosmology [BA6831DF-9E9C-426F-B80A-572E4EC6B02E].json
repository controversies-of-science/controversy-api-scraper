    "snippet" : "Reason in Revolt, Vol. I: Dialectical Philosophy and Modern Science, Ted Grant, Alan Woods\n\n\"We see a steadily increasing tendency towards a purely abstract theoretical approach to cosmology, based almost exclusively on mathematical calculations and relativity theory. 'The annual number of cosmology papers published skyrocketed from 60 in 1965 to over 500 in 1980, yet this growth was almost solely in purely theoretical work: by 1980 roughly 95% of these papers were devoted to various mathematical models, such as the 'Bianchi type XI universe.' By the mid-seventies, cosmologists' confidence was such that they felt able to describe in intimate detail events of the first one-hundredth second of time, several billion years ago. Theory increasingly took on the characteristic of myth-absolute, exact knowledge about events in the distant past but an increasingly hazy understanding of how they led to the cosmos we now see, and an increasing rejection of observation.'\"",
