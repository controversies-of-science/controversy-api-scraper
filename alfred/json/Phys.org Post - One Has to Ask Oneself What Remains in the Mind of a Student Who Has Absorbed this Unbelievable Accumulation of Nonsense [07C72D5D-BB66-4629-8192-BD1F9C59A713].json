    "snippet" : "\"When one arrives at the mathematical theories on which quantum mechanics is based, one realizes that the attitude of certain physicists in the handling of these theories truly borders on delirium ... One has to ask oneself what remains in the mind of a student who has absorbed this unbelievable accumulation of nonsense, real hogwash! It would appear that today's physicists are only at ease in the vague, the obscure, and the contradictory.\"\n\n- The mathematician J.
