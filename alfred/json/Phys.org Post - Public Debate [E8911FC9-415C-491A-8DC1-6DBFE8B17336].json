    "snippet" : "\"Scientists and politicians are forever banging on about the need for 'public debate' on the various manifestations of science, albeit with the implication that the status quo is basically fine and that the net flow of ideas should be de haut en bas. Well, we do need a public debate, but not the kind usually proposed. To put things right we need to dig very deep indeed, back to Pythagoras, and on from there, taking in most branches of moral philosophy, economics and theology. Otherwise the future life of humanity is going to be both more brutal and far shorter than it needs to be.\"\n\n- The privatisation of science, Colin Tudge, New Statesman, 2004\/04\/30",
