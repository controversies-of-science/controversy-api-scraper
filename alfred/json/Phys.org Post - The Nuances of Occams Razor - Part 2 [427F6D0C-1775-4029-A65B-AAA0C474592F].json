    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... Coherence, or Occam's razor, is a well known and important principle but two important caveats should be stated. Firstly, the coherence criterion must be used with care and moderation, applied rigidly it produces closed systems of thought. The pieces of the jigsaw already assembled may actually be in the wrong places. Secondly, the existing body of knowledge means exactly what it says and knowledge is well-founded belief (Popper). The existing body of knowledge does not mean the existing body of hypotheses. To be of any real value, a new idea must compete with existing suppositions used to explain the same data set. It is diametrically wrong to demand of a new hypothesis that it be consistent with the ideas it sets out to replace.\"\n\n- John Hewitt, A Habit of Lies",
