Although these experiments and observations have been carried out as well as or better than we could have hoped, the discoveries did not come.\n\nOver the past 15 years, for example, experiments designed to detect individual particles of dark matter have become a million times more sensitive, and yet no signs of these elusive particles have appeared ...\n\nThe stubborn elusiveness of dark matter has left many scientists both surprised and confused ...\n\nWith bruised egos and a bit more humility, we are desperately attempting to find a new way to make sense of our world.\"",
