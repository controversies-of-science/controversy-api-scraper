As things are, this most fundamental principle is compromised at every turn. Bad results are concealed; apparently favourable results are bruited in the spirit of PR; people are bought and\/or threatened so that they comply, and even that once final guarantor of honesty, 'peer review', is now routinely circumvented.\"\n\n- The privatisation of science, Colin Tudge, New Statesman, 2004\/04\/30",
