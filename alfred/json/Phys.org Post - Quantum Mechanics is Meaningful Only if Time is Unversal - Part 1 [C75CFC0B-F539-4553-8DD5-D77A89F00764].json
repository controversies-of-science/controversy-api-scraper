    "snippet" : "\"Black holes are one of the most celebrated predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which explains gravity as the warping of space-time caused by massive objects. The theory suggests that a sufficiently massive star, when it dies, will collapse under its own gravity to a single point.\n\nBut Einstein didn't believe in black holes. Unfortunately, he couldn't articulate why. At the root of the problem is the other revolutionary theory of twentieth-century physics, which Einstein also helped to formulate: quantum mechanics.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
