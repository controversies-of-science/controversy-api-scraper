    "snippet" : "\"Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.\n\nThere is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.\"\n\n- Michael Crichton, The Caltech Michelin Lecture, 17 January 2003",
