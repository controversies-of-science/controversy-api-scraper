    "snippet" : "Preface to The Golem - What You Should Know About Science\n\n\"One reviewer argues: 'it is quite easy to think of political decisions with a scientific side to them where the science is noncontroversial' and offers as an example the effect on medical institutions of the development of a predictive test for Huntington's disease. But if the science is non-controversial, why do those running the medical institutions need to understand the deep nature of the science that gave rise to the results? If the test is uncontroversially valid they can make their decisions without understanding how agreement about the test was reached. Thus, while thanking our reviewers for the many generous comments about the importance, the informativeness, and the style of the book, we stand by our claim that 'For citizens who want to take part in the democratic processes of a technological society, all the science they need to know about is controversial...'\"",
