Galter ed., Die Rolle der Astronomie in den Kulturen Mesopotamiens (Graz, 1993), p.315.\n\n\"In ancient Persia, Venus was identified with the voluptuous goddess Anahita, the latter being viewed as a warrior and agent of fertility. [7] A vestige of these ancient traditions is preserved in the Koran, one verse describing the transfiguration of a young woman into the beautiful star Zohra, an Arabic name for Venus. [8] Yet variant traditions name this young woman Anahid. [9]\"\n\n(cont'd)",
