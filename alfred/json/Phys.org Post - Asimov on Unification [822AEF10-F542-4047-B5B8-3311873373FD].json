    "snippet" : "\"If quantum theory and relativity can be combined, a true 'unified field theory' may become possible. If all this is done, however, it would be a still finer refinement that would affect the edges of the known -- the nature of the big bang and the creation of the universe, the properties at the center of black holes, some subtle points about the evolution of galaxies and supernovas, and so on. Virtually all that we know today, however, would remain untouched and when I say I am glad that I live in a century when the Universe is essentially understood, I think I am justified.\"\n\n- Isaac Asimov, The Relativity of Wrong",
