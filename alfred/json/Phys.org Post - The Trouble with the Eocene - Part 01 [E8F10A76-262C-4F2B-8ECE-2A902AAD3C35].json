Some of these giants were 35 m high, with stumps 2.5 m around, and appear to have lived for as long as 1,000 years.' [37]\n\nThe problem that has been facing paleobotanists is how such forests could have thrived in a latitude which at present would have forced them to 'sleep' through the long polar night. As Art Johnson who, independent of Basinger, have been studying these remains, noted: 'We have no forests on Earth where the trees are so big and have to sit in the dark for three months.'
