    "snippet" : "\"Thus the use of dimming corrections leads to a particular kind of universe, but one which most students are likely to reject as highly improbable.  Furthermore, the strange features of this universe are merely the dimming corrections expressed in different terms. Omit the dimming factors, and the oddities vanish. We are left with the simple, even familiar concept of a sensibly infinite universe.  All the difficulties are transferred to the interpretation of red shifts which cannot then be the familiar velocity shifts ...\n\nMeanwhile, on the basis of the evidence now available, apparent discrepancies between theory and observation must be recognized.  A choice is presented, as once before in the days of Copernicus, between a strangely small, finite universe and a sensibly infinite universe plus a new principle of nature.\"\n\n- Edwin Hubble, conclusion of The Problem of the Expanding Universe",
