Instead, they adopt a 'pragmatic' approach, in which questions of interpretation -- that is, the physical meaning of the mathematical formalism -- are simply dismissed. They take the equations themselves as the essential content of the theory, the attitude being: 'Don't worry about what the equations mean or what reality is really like. Such things don't matter. What matters is only that the mathematical laws have been discovered -- now let's just use them to calculate something.'\"\n\n- Travis Norsen, Mathematics vs. Matter: The Philosophic Roots of the Rejection of Physical Causation in 20th Century Physics",
