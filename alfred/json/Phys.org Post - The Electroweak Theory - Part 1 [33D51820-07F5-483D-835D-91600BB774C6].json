Physicists continue to debate the significance of the electroweak theory. Is it a true unification, or simply a collage of distinct laws? Whatever the case, it does not seem to go much beyond the level of formalism. While they may be described by a common theory, electromagnetism and weak interactions remain quite dissimilar. Not to mention that the theory requires no fewer than eighteen independent parameters! In the minds of many an expert, that is a nightmare comparable to the epicycles proposed long ago to explain the motion of planets.\"",
