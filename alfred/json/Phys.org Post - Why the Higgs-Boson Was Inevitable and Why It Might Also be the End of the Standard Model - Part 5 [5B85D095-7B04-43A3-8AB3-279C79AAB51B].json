    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... The point that must be stressed is that if there is no Higgs boson found that is predicted by the Standard Model of physics, it would mean the collapse of that entire theoretical framework. In his book, The Higgs Fake: How Particle Physicists Fooled the Nobel Committee, by Alexander Unzicker, page 116 cites David Lindley that the Higgs boson 'may be as well regarded as a mathematical invention.' [62]  Martinas J.G. Veltman, in this regard says, 'the only legitimate reason for introducing the Higgs boson is to make the Standard Model mathematically consistent.' [63] Like so much else, the Higgs boson is absolutely necessary to the last hundred years of particle physics research.\"",
