    "snippet" : "\"In my opinion, until we have accepted a viable theory that can explain the proton\/electron mass ratio, the magnetic moment of the proton, along with the magnetic moment of the neutron as well as proton and neutron structure plus neutron lifetime, we cannot be sure of anything on this subject. That is the real problem facing the world of physics, whether we are interested in the creation of the universe or the energy source which created it and which might come to our aid if we fathom its mysteries.\"\n\n- Harold Aspden, Our Physics World And Its Problems",
