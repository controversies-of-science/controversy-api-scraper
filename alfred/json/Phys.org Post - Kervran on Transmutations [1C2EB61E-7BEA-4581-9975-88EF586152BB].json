    "snippet" : "C. Louis Kervran, Biological Transmutations, (1971), p.97, from the English translation by Crosby Lockwood, from an original in French (1966)\n\n\"Everything concerning the origin and evolution of our planet requires reappraisal; new horizons will be opened up, not only for geologists but for philosophers and metaphysicists. The latter will also have to consider that, contrary to accepted statements, the phenomenon of life is not exclusively a matter of chemistry. There is chemistry in life processes, and obviously I would in no way deny the importance of chemistry and biochemistry in all living organisms, but life is not just physics and chemistry; there are other phenomena, namely biological transmutations.\"",
