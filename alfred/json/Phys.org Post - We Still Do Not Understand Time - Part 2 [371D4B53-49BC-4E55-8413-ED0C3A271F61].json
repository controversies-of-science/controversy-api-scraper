We are far from done with the 'interval' yet; it has some choice surprises in store. While on the subject I would cite the hankering of the Relativists for seeking to make time run backwards. Dean Inge, when President of the Aristotelian Society, illustrated their idea. He imagined a diver plunging into the water, and then described the cinematograph film moving in the reverse order. This was not a case of time moving backward, but simply of one set of (visual) images being noted, and then, still in sequence of time, another series.
