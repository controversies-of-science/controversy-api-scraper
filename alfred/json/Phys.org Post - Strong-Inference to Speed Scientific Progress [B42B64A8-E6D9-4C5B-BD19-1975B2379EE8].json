Jewett, What’s Wrong With Single Hypotheses? – It’s time to eschew enthrallment in science\", The Scientist, Volume 19, Issue 21, p. 10, Nov 7, 2005\n\n\"To speed scientific progress, Platt [$] suggested the use of 'strong-inference,' a thumbnail sketch of which includes:\n\n1. Identify a scientifically interesting observation.\n\n2. Enumerate all alternative hypotheses that can account for the observation, based on present knowledge.\n\n3. Reject hypotheses by experimental observations until a single hypothesis remains that has survived an experimental test by which it could have been rejected. The remaining hypothesis is the currently held view of the cause of the observation.\"\n\n[$] J. R. Platt “Strong inference,” Science 1964, 146: 347-53.",
