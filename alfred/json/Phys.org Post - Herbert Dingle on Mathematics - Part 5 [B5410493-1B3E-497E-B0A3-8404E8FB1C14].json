    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"If this is a true diagnosis -- and I think facts available since Whitehead wrote these words unmistakably confirm it -- mathematical ability and ability to conduct operations of thought are distinct faculties, and although I know of no reason why they should not co-exist in the same person, it is only too clear that at the present time, except in a rare instance, they do not. The danger that the cultivation of the former should cripple the latter is thus so real that positive steps should be taken to counteract it. In fact, however our methods of education augment it. In the application of mathematics to physics the results of this are shown in such examples as those which I have given, and in many others.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
