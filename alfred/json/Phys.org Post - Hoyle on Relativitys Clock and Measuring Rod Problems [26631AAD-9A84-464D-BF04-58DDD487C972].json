    "snippet" : "Fred Hoyle, The Universe: Past And Present Reflections, Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 1982. 20, p.18\n\n\"True to my belief in rote learning, I could reproduce, like the lines of Macbeth or King Lear, most of the details given in Eddington's The Mathematical Theory of Relativity. One day, while pondering the relation of certain of the mathematical symbols to actual physical measurements of space and time, I decided my understanding of the meaning of 'clocks' and 'measuring rods' was defective. I had come upon the difficulty in the general theory of relativity, but it was soon apparent that the same problem occurred also in the special theory, which to this point I had thought easy meat. To my horror, I now found I couldn't understand the apparently simple special theory. So how could I possibly take an examination in the far more difficult general theory?\"",
