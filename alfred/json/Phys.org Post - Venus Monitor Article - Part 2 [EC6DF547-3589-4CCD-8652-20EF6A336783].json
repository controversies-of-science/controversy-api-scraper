    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Pioneer has shown that there is enough carbon dioxide (and the tiny proportion of water vapour) needed to make the greenhouse effect work -- just.  If this is the whole story, the total amount of radiation emitted back into space, after its journey up through the atmospheric blanket, must be exactly equal to that absorbed from sunlight (otherwise the surface temperature would be continuously changing).\n\nBut Taylor found that Venus radiates 15 per cent more energy than it receives.  To keep the surface temperature constant, Venus must be producing this extra heat from within.\n\nAll the inner planets, including the Earth, produce internal heat from radioactive elements in their rocks ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
