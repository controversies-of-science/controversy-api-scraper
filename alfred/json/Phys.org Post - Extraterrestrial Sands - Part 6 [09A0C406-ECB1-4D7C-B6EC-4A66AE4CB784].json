    "snippet" : "p151:\n\n\"Most sand grains are coated with a thin glaze (varnish) of iron-rich clay minerals; it is this that gives the sand (and sandstone) its color. It is a very similar chemical reaction to that of a rusting nail ... In environments of high energy (i.e. beach sands) this varnish can be washed off to reveal the true color of the quartz grain, which is in most cases clear with a yellow tinge ...\n\nThe most detailed study of stained quartz sands has been done in Australia. Sands from beaches in south-eastern Australia revealed (by examination using a scanning electron microscope) that the hydrated iron oxide (goethite) coatings were adhering not directly to the quartz grains, but to a submicroscopic clay coating. It was found that the clay coatings are a co-requisite for iron staining. In fact, they found no instances where an iron stain on a quartz grain consisted of solely iron oxide.\"",
