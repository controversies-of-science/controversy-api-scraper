    "snippet" : "\"If the theoretical physicist entered into his activities merely as a mental exercise, in the manner of some of the more abstruse mathematical developments, no exception could be taken to his procedure, but as matters now stand, the theorist who is working with 'creatures of the imagination' sooner or later shifts his ground and starts claiming that his conclusions are applicable to the real world. Thus we find the Copenhagen school of physicists, principal architects of the present-day 'official' atomic theory, asserting that the particles of which their 'atom' is constructed are not 'material particles in space and time' and do not 'exist objectively.'\"\n\n- Heisenberg, Werner, Philosophic Problems of Nuclear Science, Pantheon Books, New York, 1952, p.55 (In Dewey B. Larson, New Light on Space & Time)\n",
