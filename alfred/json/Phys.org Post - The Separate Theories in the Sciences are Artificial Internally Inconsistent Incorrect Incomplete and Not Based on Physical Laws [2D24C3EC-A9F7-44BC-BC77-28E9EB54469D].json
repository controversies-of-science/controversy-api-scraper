    "snippet" : "\"The universe is not mathematical; it is physical. A separate theory for near light speed mechanics, special relativity as it now exists, is unnecessary and incomplete. For example, in addition to the problems raised previously, the famous equation E = Mc2 does not predict fundamental particle masses, inertial or gravitational or why they are equivalent. Furthermore, separate theories of atomic physics such as quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, separate nuclear theories such as quantum chromodynamics, a separate theory for particles such as the standard model, a separate theory for gravity, general relativity as it now exits, and separate theories for cosmology such as the Big Bang, inflation, and dark energy are artificial, internally inconsistent, incorrect, incomplete, and not based on physical laws.\"\n\n- The Grand Unified Theory of classical Physics, Randell L.
