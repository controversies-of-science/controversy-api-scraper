Later he proposed as a possibility that small aggregations of the most refractory materials form at the level of the Sun's atmosphere where the temperature attains its minimum value of about 4,000'K. An expert on electrical discharges, he asserts that wherever there is dust (particulate matter) and convection in a gas, separation of charge and the buildup of electric potentials will occur. He regards electrical discharges as a perennial feature all over the Sun, and as responsible for the emission of the solar streams and shells that cause magnetic storms. At my invitation, he contributed a brief account of his ideas on this subject to the published version (de Witt, Hieblot, and Lebeau, 1963) of my 1962 lectures at the Les Houches summer school ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
