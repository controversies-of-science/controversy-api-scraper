    "snippet" : "The idea of the black hole is based upon what is known as the Schwarzschild Solution; but Schwarzschild did not even write it. In fact, Swarzschild did not say anything about black holes at all, because his solution does not even allow them. One of the most popular concepts in science today is a purely mathematical conjecture riddled with contradictions, ambiguities and a history of mathematicians warning that it would not work.\n\nWho here has taken the time to even learn about these claims, much less seek to rebut them?",
