Gott and his colleague Li-Xin Li also devised a cosmological model even stranger than GÃ¶del's in which an entire universe, with a finite life cycle, traces out a loop in time so that its end is also its beginning.\n\nOne much-discussed design for a time machine involves a 'wormhole': two black holes linked together by a tunnel or spacewarp.The tunnel could exist only if it were made of a substance that has a very large negative pressure (or tension). Theorists speculate that exotic stuff of this kind did exist in the early universe, but even if such material still existed, the mass needed in order to make a wormhole wide enough to be comfortably traversed by a human would be 10,000 times that of the Sun!\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.93-94",
