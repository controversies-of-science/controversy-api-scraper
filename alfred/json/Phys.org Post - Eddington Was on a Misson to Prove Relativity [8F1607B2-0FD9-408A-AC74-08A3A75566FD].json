    "snippet" : "Fabulous Science Fact and Fiction in the History of Scientific Discovery\nJohn Waller\n(p53)\n\n\"Both 1918–19 eclipse expeditions comprised British physicists. The first team, which observed the eclipse from Sobral in Brazil ... The other, headed by Arthur Eddington and his assistant E. Cottingham, made its observations from the island of Principe, which lies off the coast of West Africa. Eddington, born in the English Lake District, was already an eminent Cambridge physicist and it was his interpretation of both teams’ data-sets that would serve to vindicate Einstein. For this reason it is noteworthy that even before departing for Principe he was well known for his Einsteinian sympathies. As the most important expositor of general relativity within Britain, most of his colleagues knew that he was undertaking the eclipse expedition in the fervent hope of confirming his radical intuition that Einstein was right.\"",
