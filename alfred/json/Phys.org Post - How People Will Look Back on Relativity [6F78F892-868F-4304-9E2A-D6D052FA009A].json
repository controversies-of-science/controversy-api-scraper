    "snippet" : "Arthur Lynch, The Case Against Einstein, Dodd, Mead & Co., New York, 1933\n\n\"Yet, as I cast my eye over the whole course of science, I behold instances of false science, even more pretentious and popular than that of Einstein, gradually fading into ineptitude under the searchlight; and I have no doubt that there will arise a new generation who will look with a wonder and amazement, deeper than now accompany Einstein, at our galaxy of thinkers, men of science, popular critics, authoritative professors, and witty dramatists, who have been satisfied to waive their common sense in view of Einstein's absurdities. Then to these will succeed another generation, whose interest will be that of a detached and half-amused contemplation; and in the limbo of forgotten philosophies they may search for the cenotaph of Relativity.\"\n\n(cenotaph: a sepulchral monument erected in memory of a deceased person whose body is buried elsewhere.)",
