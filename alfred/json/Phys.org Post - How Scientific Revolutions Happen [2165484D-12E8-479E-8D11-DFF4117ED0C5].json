    "snippet" : "\"... earth science is ripe for a major scientific revolution, that in a lesser way, its present situation is like that of astronomers before the ideas of Copernicus and Galileo were accepted, like that of chemistry before the ideas of atoms and molecules were introduced, like that of biology before evolution, like that of physics before quantum mechanics. Before each revolution, all the pegs seemed square and all the holes round. In each case, it was not until it was realized that one had to discard the whole frame of reference and seek another that answers came in a flood ... It is not our methods nor our observations that have been wrong, but our whole attitude.\"\n\n- J.
