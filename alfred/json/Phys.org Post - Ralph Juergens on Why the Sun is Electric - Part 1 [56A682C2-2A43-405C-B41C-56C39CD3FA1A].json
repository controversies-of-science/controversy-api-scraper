    "snippet" : "Ralph E. Juergens, Pensée, Volume II Number 3. Fall, 1972\n\n\"The kind of electric discharge I conceive to be responsible for solar radiation must necessarily be driven by an electric potential in interstellar space -- a condition to be expected in a galaxy electrified by the separation of charges on a truly magnificent scale.\"\n\nRalph E. Juergens, Forum, Pensée, Volume 4, Number 1. Winter, 1973-74\n\n\"Having come this far, I could no longer avoid asking the unthinkable: Could it be that the sun and the other stars are not fired by thermonuclear reactions? If stellar atmospheres are electric-discharge media, then electric currents capable of supplying the radiant energy of the stars must flow through them, and internal fires would be superfluous.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
