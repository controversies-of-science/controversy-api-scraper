    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... Even more impressive, the computer simulations of the laboratory experiments generate synchrotron radiation in a pattern nearly identical with the one observed in double radio galaxies-including the distinctive hot spots.\n\nConfident that simulated plasmas mimic phenomena observed in distant space, physicists have run further computer simulations to study how galaxies might form from plasma currents. From 1979 until 1986 James C. Green of Stanford University and I used supercomputers to simulate the long-term effects of plasma forces on a double radio galaxy with the characteristics of Cygnus A. To verify the method, the lobe structures generated in the computer simulation were compared frame by frame and in fine detail with the lobe structure of numerous double radio galaxies, peculiar galaxies and ordinary galaxies mapped by telescope. Our results were stunning ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
