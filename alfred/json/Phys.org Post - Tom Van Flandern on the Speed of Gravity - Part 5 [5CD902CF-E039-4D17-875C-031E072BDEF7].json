    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Indeed, it is widely accepted, even if less widely known, that the speed of gravity in Newtonâ€™s Universal Law is unconditionally infinite. (E.g., Misner et al., 1973, p. 177) This is usually not mentioned in proximity to the statement that GR reduces to Newtonian gravity in the low-velocity, weak-field limit because of the obvious question it begs about how that can be true if the propagation speed in one model is the speed of light, and in the other model it is infinite.\"",
