    "snippet" : "\"Science has been the great intellectual adventure of our age, and a great hope for our troubled and restless world. But I did not expect science merely to extend lifespan, feed the hungry, cure disease, and shrink the world with jets and cell phones, I also expected science to banish the evils of human thought -- prejudice and superstition, irrational beliefs and false fears. I expected science to be, in Carl Sagan's memorable phrase, 'a candle in a demon haunted world.'\n\nAnd here, I am not so pleased with the impact of science. Rather than serving as a cleansing force, science has in some instances been seduced by the more ancient lures of politics and publicity. Some of the demons that haunt our world in recent years are invented by scientists. The world has not benefited from permitting these demons to escape free.\"\n\n- Michael Crichton, Michelin Lecture at Caltech, January 17, 2005",
