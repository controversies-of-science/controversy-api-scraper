    "snippet" : "Freeman J. Dyson in the Australian Academy of Science Silver Jubilee Symposium, Vol II, 1980, Is Real Mathematics of any use to physics? p.2\n\n\"School mathematics is a tool which physicists and carpenters may easily master and apply every day to the practical needs of their work. A physicist uses school mathematics to design apparatus, to reduce data, to compare experimental results with theory. But real mathematics is something different. Real mathematics is not a tool but a form of art. 'A mathematician,' says Hardy, 'like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.'",
