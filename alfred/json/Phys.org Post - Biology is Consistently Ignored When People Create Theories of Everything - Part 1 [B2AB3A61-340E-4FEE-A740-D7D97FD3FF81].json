    "snippet" : "\"Basically, in any general physical theory, the so-called Theory-Of-Everything (TOE), the problems of biology are ignored. Scientists can shut their eyes on these problems by tacitly assuming that biology is just a formidable complexity piled up on top of wonderful physics. This attitude leads nowhere. As said Ludwig Wittgenstein: 'Even when all the possible scientific questions have been answered, the problems of life remain completely untouched.'\"\n\n- Simon Berkovich, Ultimate irreversibility in the Universe: continuous holographic recording of every event and biological memory as a part of it",
