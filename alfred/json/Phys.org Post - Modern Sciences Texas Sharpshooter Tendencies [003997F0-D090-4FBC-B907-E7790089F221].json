    "snippet" : "Not Even Trying: The Corruption of Real Science\nBruce G Charlton\n(p73-77)\n\n\"[M]odern technological advances are not imposed problems; they are instead examples of the Texas Sharpshooter fallacy.\n\nThe joke of the Texas Sharpshooter is that he fires his gun many times into a barn door, then draws a target over the bullet holes, with the bulls-eye over the closest cluster of bullet holes.\n\nIn other words, the Texas Sharpshooter makes it look as if he had been aiming at the bulls-eye and had hit it, when in fact he drew the bulls-eye only after he took the shots.\n\nModern science and engineering is like that.  People do research and development, and then proclaim triumphantly that whatever they have done is a breakthrough.  They have achieved whatever-happens-to-come-out-of-R&D; and then they spin, hype and market whatever-happens-to-come-out-of-R&D as if it were a major breakthrough.\"",
