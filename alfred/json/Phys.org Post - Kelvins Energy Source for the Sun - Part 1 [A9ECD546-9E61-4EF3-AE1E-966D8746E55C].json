In an early (1854) version of this idea, Kelvin suggested that the sun's heat might be produced continually by the impact of meteors falling onto its surface.  Kelvin was forced by astronomical evidence to modify his hypothesis and he then argued that the primary source of the energy available to the sun was the gravitational energy of the primordial meteors from which it was formed.\n\nThus, with great authority and eloquence Lord Kelvin declared in 1862:\n\nThat some form of the meteoric theory is certainly the true and complete explanation of solar heat can scarcely be doubted, when the following reasons are considered:\n\n(1) No other natural explanation, except by chemical action, can be conceived.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
