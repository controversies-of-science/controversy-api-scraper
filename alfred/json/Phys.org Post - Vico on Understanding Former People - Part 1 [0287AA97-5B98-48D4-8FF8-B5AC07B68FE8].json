    "snippet" : "From the 1997 anthology of essays by Isaiah Berlin (The Proper Study of Mankind). This excerpt from The Sciences and the Humanities, describing the ideas of Giambattista Vico (1668-1744):\n\n\"[M]athematics was indeed ... a discipline which led to wholly clear, irrefutable propositions of universal validity. But this was so not because the language of mathematics was a reflection of the basic and unalterable structure of reality ... [but] because mathematics was not a reflection of anything. Mathematics was not a discovery but a human invention: starting from definitions and axioms of their own choosing, mathematicians could, by means of rules of which they or other men were authors, arrive at conclusions that did indeed logically follow, because the man-made rules, definitions and axioms saw to it that they did so. Mathematics was a kind of game ... a play of abstractions controlled by their creators ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
