    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... Would it seem rational to speculate that this force is something entirely new and completely different from electromagnetics? Would it not be a great foolishness to invent something new and call it gravity and claim that it has no relationship with the known forces, and then write elaborate mathematical theories which describe it solely as geometry? Or, would it be more rational to see it as what it probably is -- a manifestation of the electromagnetic forces which we already know to hold matter together?\n\nCould it be that electric charge is a fundamental thing, and inertial mass is merely a shadow of something primal, and what we know as a gravitational field is merely the net result of other primary fields? Geometrize it if you find it useful to do so, but please recognize that defining gravity as geometry lends no information to the understanding of its cause.\n\nOf all the forces we know, there is none stronger than a paradigm.\"\n\n- Robert Stirniman",
