Exploration, Vol. 3, No. 2, p.103-112, 1989\n\n\"When in a subject a general attitude or a viewpoint has become established, then it is very easy to obtain funds to do work in that subject on the bases of what I call 'shoehorn science.' I think you will understand what I mean by that. If you make your proposal which says: 'I will demonstrate how this fact and that fact, that apparently are difficult to see in the accepted framework, can be figured into that framework,' they are all delighted to give you money. And by the time that has gone on for a long time, so much work of the shoehorn kind has been diligently done to force the facts into the pattern that is preordained, that it then looks to many people as if it all was firmly established. What happens is that they build a superstructure on what may be no foundation -- if I may invent a 'Confucius say' sort of proverb, 'Never judge the strength of foundation by size of building.'\"",
