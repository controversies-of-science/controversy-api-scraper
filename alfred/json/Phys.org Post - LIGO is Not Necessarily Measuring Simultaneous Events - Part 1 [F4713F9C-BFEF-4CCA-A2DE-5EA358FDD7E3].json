The experiment is a textbook example of pathological science -- matching signal patterns from a huge database of 250,000 theoretical templates of alleged binary black hole collisions, hoping one might coincide with the infinitessimal recorded signals.\n\nCritical to the detection algorithm is that the alleged gravitational waves are assumed to travel at the speed of light.  So, there is a time delay expected between similar signal patterns between separate LIGO detectors.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
