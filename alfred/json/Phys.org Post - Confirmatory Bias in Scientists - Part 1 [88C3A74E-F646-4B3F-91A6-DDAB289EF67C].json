Mahoney, Publication Prejudices: An Experimental Study of Confirmatory Bias in the Peer Review System, Cognitive Therapy and Research, Vol. 1 No. 2, 1977, p.161-175\n\n\"Confirmatory bias. This refers to the tendency for humans to seek out, attend to, and sometimes embellish experiences that support or 'confirm' their beliefs. Confirmatory experiences are selectively welcomed and granted easy credibility. Disconfirmatory experiences, on the other hand, are often ignored, discredited, or treated with obvious defensiveness. A depressed client who thinks he is helpless may thus pay more attention to his failures and shortcomings. The tragic effects of confirmatory bias are not, however, restricted to clinical disorders. In fact ... the most costly expression of this tendency may well be among scientists themselves ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
