Exploration, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp 103-112, 1989\n\n\"The pace of scientific work continues to accelerate, but the question is whether the pace of DISCOVERY will continue to accelerate. If we were driving in the wrong direction -- in the direction where no new ideas can be accepted -- then even if scientific work goes on, the progress would be stifled. This is not to suggest that we are in quite such a disastrous position, but on the other hand, all is not well.\"",
