Stewart, an astronomer at Princeton in the early 1950's, made the pronouncement that Venus could never have had an orbit, other than the one it is presently in, because the current orbit fits so well with Bode's Law.  It turns out that Bode's Law is not really a Law of physics.  It is now called a rule.  Not only that, it was stolen from Titius by Bode.  To compromise, some people later started calling it the Titius-Bode Rule.  Often, now, it is just called the Titius Rule.  It is basically a formula that was generated to fit the orbital distances of the planets from the Sun.  One should not be surprised that it fits what is seen today; because the formula was made to do just that.\"",
