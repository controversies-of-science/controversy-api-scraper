García-Berro et al., Astronomical measurements and constraints on the variability of fundamental constants, Astron Astrophys Rev (2007) 14:113–170\n\n\"All the laws of nature establishing relations between various dynamical characteristics involve parameters (or factors) which are assumed to be independent of the time or of the space–time location and are thus regarded as constants of nature. For example, the gravitational interaction contains the gravitational constant, G. In fact, the statement about the constancy of the 'constants' is just a hypothesis, though quite an important one. It is a part of the Copernican principle and is crucial for comparing and reproducing experiments. However, it is not senseless to question its validity.\"",
