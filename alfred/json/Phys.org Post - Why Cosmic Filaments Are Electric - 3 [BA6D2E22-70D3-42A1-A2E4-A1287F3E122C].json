Within the cylindrical filament, both the current and the magnetic field will spiral around the axis of the cylinder whilst remaining parallel to each other.\n\nNote that if for any reason the parallel alignment between I and the total B is disturbed, then an I Ã— B force will arise and cause either radial compression or radial expansion, depending on which of the two components is more axial ...\"",
