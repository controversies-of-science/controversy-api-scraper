    "snippet" : "Peter Warlow, The Reversing Earth, 1982, p.187\n\n\"These days, in order to achieve publication of a scientific paper, it is demanded that some form of mathematical theory be available to back up the claims. Indeed, a state has been reached wherein all sorts of wild hypothesizing is considered acceptable as long as it is in a mathematical form. Whether or not it relates to reality seems to be a minor issue. In fact, if someone does deign to descend to reality, more often than not they are condemned for pointing out that all that nice theorizing that has been going on doesn't actually fit the facts at base level. This, of course, means that the whole edifice of theory and hypothesis must fail, and perhaps that is why there is such a remarkable reluctance to accept the alternative views.\"",
