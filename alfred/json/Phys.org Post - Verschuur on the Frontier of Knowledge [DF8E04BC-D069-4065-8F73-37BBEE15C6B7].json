Verschuur, Interstellar Matters, p.292-293\n\n\"This challenge, to think outside what is already known, is a journey many a scientist must undertake if he wishes to cross the frontier of knowledge ... Sometimes the intrepid voyager may, for a while at least, sail out of sight of land, the land of agreed-upon doctrine, and there discover new worlds, new thoughts. The problem then shifts because a description of the unknown beyond the horizon may not be readily understood. Then the task of communicating insight may be made nearly impossible and history is replete with incidents where a scientist saw too far ahead and was no longer understood by his or her peers.\"",
