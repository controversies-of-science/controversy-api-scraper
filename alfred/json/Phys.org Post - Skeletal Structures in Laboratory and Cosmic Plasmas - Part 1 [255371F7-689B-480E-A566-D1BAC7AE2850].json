Kukushkin and V.A. Rantsev-Kartinov\n\n\"This papers briefly reviews the progress in studying the long-lived filamentary structures of a skeletal form (namely, tubules and cartwheels, and their simple combinations) in electric discharges in various fusion devices. These include fast Z-pinch, tokamak and laser produced plasmas. We also report on the results of a search for the phenomenon of skeletal structures -- formerly revealed in laboratory data from fusion devices -- at larger and much larger length scales, including the powerful electromagnetic phenomena in the Earth atmosphere and cosmic space ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
