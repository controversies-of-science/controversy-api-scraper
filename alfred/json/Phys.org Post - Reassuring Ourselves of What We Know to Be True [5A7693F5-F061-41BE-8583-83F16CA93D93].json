    "snippet" : "\"Wittgenstein mentions [the man] in Philosophical Investigations, who purchases several copies of the morning paper to reassure himself that what he reads there is true. Committing this fallacy is both a common individual fault and also structurally embedded in modern scientific administration. Of course, scientists do not buy many copies of their morning paper, but they do publish many copies of the same, or very similar, experiment; then they point to the 'mountain of evidence' supporting their ideas.\"\n\n- John Hewitt, A Habit of Lies",
