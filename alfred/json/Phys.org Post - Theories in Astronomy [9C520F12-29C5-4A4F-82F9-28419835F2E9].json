    "snippet" : "\"Probably in no branch of the sciences is there such misuse of the term theory as in astronomy. This misuse finds its way into science magazines, TV and radio broadcasts, science news web sites, and even encyclopedias. Many of the conjectures about the solar system's formation are bantered as theories when they really are insufficiently scrutinized hypotheses.\"\n\n- Lance May, The Origin of Our Moon, Journal of Theoretics, Volume 6-1, Feb-March 2004",
