On the contrary: If the new information is consonant with our beliefs, we think it is well founded and useful: 'Just what I always said!' But if the new information is dissonant, then we consider it biased or foolish: 'What a dumb argument!' So powerful is the need for consonance that when people are forced to look at disconfirming evidence, they will find a way to criticize, distort, or dismiss it so that they can maintain or even strengthen their existing belief.' This mental contortion is called the 'confirmation bias.'\"",
