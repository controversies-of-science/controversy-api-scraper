Be aware that Hubble, himself, never believed that the redshifts of faraway galaxies meant the universe was expanding. He always thought it was a measure of distance rather than recessional velocity -- more of a 'tired light' effect. For positivists who actually believed in perfectly empty space, there was no reason to entertain such a heresy. Why would light lose energy traveling through perfectly empty space?\"",
