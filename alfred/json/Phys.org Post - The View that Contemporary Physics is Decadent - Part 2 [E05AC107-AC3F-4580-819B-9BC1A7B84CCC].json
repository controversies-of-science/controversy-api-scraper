Some point out that, when contradictory observations do arise, beloved theories are artificially modified rather than discarded.\n\nTo those who see decadence in all this, these over-mathematized physicists are reviving the Ptolemaic method. Ptolemy started out from the conviction that the earth was at the centre of the universe and then proceeded to devise an astronomical model around this certainty.
