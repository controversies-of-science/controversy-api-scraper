    "snippet" : "\"Here, then, is the reason why the serious shortcomings of the Special Theory are currently looked upon so charitably. Nothing better is now available, and the physicists are not willing to concede that they might have overlooked the correct answer. But the facts are clear. No new conceptual information has been added to the previously existing body of knowledge concerning space and time by the Michelson-Morley experiment and the theoretical developments aimed at explaining the results of that experiment. The Special Theory of Relativity is nothing more than an erroneous hypothesis: a conspicuous addition to the historical record cited by Jeans; another example of a mathematical formula that is right, or very nearly right, clothed with a physical interpretation that is very badly wrong.\"\n\n- Dewey B.
