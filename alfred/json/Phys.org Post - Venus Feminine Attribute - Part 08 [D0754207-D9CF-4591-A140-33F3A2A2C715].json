    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"The Inca knew Venus as a lovely woman by the name of Chasca [19], renowned for her long-flowing hair. An anonymous Jesuit of the seventeenth century described the planet-goddess as especially devoted to women and princesses:\n\n'[Of Venus] they said that she was a goddess of young maidens and princesses, and originator of the flowers of the fields, and mistress of dawn and twilight; and it was she who drew onto the earth when she shook her hair, and they thus called her Chasca.'\"\n\n[19] De las costumbres antiguas de los naturales del Piru (Madrid, 1879), as translated by Jan Sammer, \"The Cosmology of Tawantinsuyu,\" Kronos 9:2 (1984), p.25.
