    "snippet" : "\"Relativity textbooks all contain the story of how the Michelson-Morley experiment supposedly proved the non-existence of a light-carrying medium, the ether. But physical reality is more complicated then the foundational myth of relativity would have us believe. An examination of historical papers on the subject indicates that relativists have rewritten history. The Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 found only a fraction of the effect size predicted by the stationary ether hypothesis, thus clearly disproving it, but the effect was emphatically not 'null' within the accuracy of the experiment. Dayton C. Miller, in The Ether-Drift Experiments and the Determination of the Absolute Motion of the Earth (Reviews of Modern Physics, Volume 5, July 1933, p.203- 241) writes ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
