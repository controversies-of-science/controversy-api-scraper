    "snippet" : "\"To speculate, as an amazing number of physicists do, nowadays, about the 'mass of the photon' is about as useful as speculating about the momentum or power-to-weight ratio of an angel in flight. If you accept what is plain fact, that what is called a 'photon' is the smallest amount of energy there is, then it follows that it has no energy to spare in manifesting itself anywhere, in any form, between where it is emitted and where it is absorbed, so that any question of how it 'travels' or what else it does in between A and B is simply a daft question.\"\n\n- UMBALA - A Polemic Against Jargon-Addiction in Modern Physics, Viv Pope, Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Meeting of the Alternative Natural Philosophy Association (ANPA, Cambridge UK)",
