    "snippet" : "de Sitter, W., Kosmos, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1932, p.106 (In Dewey B. Larson, Beyond Newton)\n\n\"Willem de Sitter is very explicit about this situation in his book Kosmos. He points out that no one, Einstein or anyone else, has actually explained gravitation, in spite of all the effort that has been devoted to the task: 'In the course of history a great number of hypotheses have been proposed in order to 'explain' gravitation, but not one of these has ever had the least chance, they have all been failures.' De Sitter then goes on to say that Einstein's actual accomplishment is to make gravitation identical with inertia, which eliminates the need for an explanation, as 'Inertia has from the beginning been admitted as one of the fundamental facts of nature, which have to be accepted without explanation, like the axioms of geometry.'\"",
