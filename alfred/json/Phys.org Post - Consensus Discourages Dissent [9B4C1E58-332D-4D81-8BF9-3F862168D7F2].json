    "snippet" : "\"Consensus discourages dissent ... It is the enemy of science, just as it is the triumph of politics. A theory accepted by 99 percent of scientists may be wrong. Committees ... that decide which projects shall be funded are inevitably run by scientists who are at peace with the dominant theory. Changing the consensus ... will be an arduous task, like turning a supertanker with a broken rudder ... the competition of theories has been the driving force behind scientific progress. Isolated individuals and private companies have been the most fruitful sources of this advance.\"\n\n- paraphrasing Tom Bethel, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science",
