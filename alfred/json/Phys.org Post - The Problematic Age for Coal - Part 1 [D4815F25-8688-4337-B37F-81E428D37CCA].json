    "snippet" : "Conventional theory holds that coal deposits were largely formed 300 million years ago.  Since the halflife of C14 is 5,730 years, any C14 that was present in the coal at the time of formation should have long since decayed to stable daughter products.  But coal seams commonly exhibit C14 dates.  In the rush to explain this away, researchers have pointed to how easy it is to contaminate the dates.\n\n(cont'd)",
