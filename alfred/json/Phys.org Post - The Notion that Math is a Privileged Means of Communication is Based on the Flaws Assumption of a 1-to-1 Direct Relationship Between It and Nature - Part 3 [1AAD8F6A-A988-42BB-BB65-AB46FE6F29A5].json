Admittance to the inner sanctum of elevated scientific pursuits requires adherence to a set of carefully defined values and rites of passage. Anyone who steps outside the accepted parameters does so at the risk of their credentials, access to research data and funding support, and the ability to share their findings in the official publications of the Scientific community. If this sounds very similar to the way the Catholic Church treated Copernicus and Galileo, it is because the dynamics of heretical proscription and ostracism are not unique to religious orders.\"\n\n- David G.
