Here it abruptly jumps hundreds of thousands of degrees, then continues slowly rising, eventually reaching 2 million degrees in the corona. Even at a distance of one or two solar diameters, ionized oxygen atoms reach 200 million degrees!\n\nIn other words the 'reverse temperature gradient,' while meeting the tests of the glow discharge model, contradicts every original expectation of the fusion model.\n\nBut this is only the first of many enigmas and contradictions facing the fusion hypothesis. As astronomer Fred Hoyle pointed out years ago, with the strong gravity and the mere 5,800-degree temperature at the surface, the Sunâ€™s atmosphere should be only a few thousand kilometers thick, according to the 'gas laws' astrophysicists typically apply to such bodies.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
