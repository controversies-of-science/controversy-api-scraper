It is found that the similarity of, and a trend toward self-similarity in, the observed skeletal structures more or less uniformly covers the range 10^-5 - 10^23 cm. These evidences suggest all these skeletal structures, similarly to skeletons in the particles of dust and hail, to possess a fractal condensed matter of particular topology of the fractal. The probable role of the phenomenon of self-assembling of a fractal dust in fusion devices and outside the fusion is discussed briefly.\"",
