    "snippet" : "Fred Hoyle, The Universe: Past And Present Reflections, Ann. Rev. Astron. Astrophys. 1982. 20, p.15\n\n\"Taking the view, palatable to most ordinary folk but exceedingly unpalatable to scientists, that there is an enormous intelligence abroad in the Universe, it becomes necessary to write blind forces out of astronomy. Interstellar grains, living cells, are to be regarded as powerful tools, every bit as purposeful if you like as a garden spade. We know from astronomical studies that the [interstellar] grains are mysteriously connected with a whole range of phenomena: the rate of condensation of stars; the mass function of stars; magnetic fields; spiral arms of galaxies; and quite probably with the formation of planetary systems. Not one of these phenomena has been explained in better than fuzzy terms, just as the views of the imaginary travellers in the spaceship would be fuzzy if they attempted to explain terrestrial fields, walls, and ditches as products of the blind forces of nature.\"",
