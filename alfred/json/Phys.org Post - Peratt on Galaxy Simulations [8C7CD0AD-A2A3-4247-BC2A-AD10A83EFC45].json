Peratt, New Beginnings: Creating the Universe Without the Big Bang, The Sciences, Jan\/Feb 1990, p.29\n\n\"With supercomputers, physicists have for the first time been able to simulate the interaction of plasma currents. In the simulations galaxy-like plasma structures have been generated that closely match the shapes of all known kinds of galaxies. The computer simulations, supported by recent observations of intergalactic plasmas, give strong evidence that plasmas do indeed play a primary role in the formation of the cosmos.\"",
