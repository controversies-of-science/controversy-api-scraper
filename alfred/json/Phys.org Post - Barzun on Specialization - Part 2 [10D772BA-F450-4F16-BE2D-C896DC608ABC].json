    "snippet" : "Jacques Barzun, Science: the glorious entertainment, p.7\n\n\"But in matters of public interest the public must judge and not ask its guides for certificates and guaranties, for there are no guaranties. It is an error to suppose that when a physicist talks about science he is bound to be more reliable than a so-called layman who has taken the trouble to inform himself and to think. For if scientific specialization means anything, it means that the physicist has final authority only on such questions of physics as fall within his specialty.\"",
