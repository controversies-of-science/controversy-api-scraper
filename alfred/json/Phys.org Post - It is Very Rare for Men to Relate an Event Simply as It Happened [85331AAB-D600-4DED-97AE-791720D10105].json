When they see or hear anything new, they are, unless strictly on their guard, so occupied with their own preconceived opinions that they perceive something quite different from the plain facts seen or heard ... for most people think they sufficiently understand a thing when they have ceased to wonder at it.\"\n\n- A Theologico-Political Treatise, 1670 (Pub Anon.), Benedict de Spinoza (1632-1677)",
