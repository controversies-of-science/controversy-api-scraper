While known for its coarseness, sand is not exactly tough and gets worn down into dust over time. Given the effect of wind, sand grains travel “in a sequence of repeated hops” — a process called saltation — in which they rise above the surface, then crash down to the ground and bounce up again, NASA said in another statement. The process of rubbing against each other as they move also erodes sand grains, and the tiny bits that break off contribute to dust, in a process known as communition.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
