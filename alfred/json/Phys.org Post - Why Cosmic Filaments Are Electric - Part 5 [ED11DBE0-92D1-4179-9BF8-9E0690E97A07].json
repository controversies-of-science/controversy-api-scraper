    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"A further effect related to the I × B force can also be determined by analysis.\n\nSuppose that the current I is caused by an electric field E. Now consider the force arising from the interaction of E and B. Remember that I tends to become aligned with the total B due to the forces on the current itself. Then the E causing the current will not be entirely aligned with the total B, which is the vector sum of the external magnetic field through which the current flows and the azimuthal magnetic field generated by the current itself.\n\nAs with the I × B force, there is also an E × B force, whenever E is not parallel to B. This E × B force acts on charged particles in the current cylinder and causes both ions and electrons to move towards the centre of a filament. Plasmas often contain a high proportion of charged dust grains, which will also be drawn into the filament ...\"",
