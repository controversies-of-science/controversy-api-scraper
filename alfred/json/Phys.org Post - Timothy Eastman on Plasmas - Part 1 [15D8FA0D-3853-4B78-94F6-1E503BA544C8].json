    "snippet" : "\"Estimates of the filling fraction for ionized particles in the interstellar and intergalactic medium range from a few percent to 100 percent. As shown by Earth's ionosphere where the ionization fraction is only a few percent, plasma processes can be important even for low filling fraction. Plasmas are a combination of neutrals, ions, electrons and fields that have conductive and collective effects and where the inter-particle dynamics is not dominated simply by binary collisions. This condition applies for most astrophysical systems. Even though space plasmas maintain quasi-neutrality to within less than about 1 part per million, there can still be substantial currents, convection, plasma flows, plasma waves and shocks and other plasma effects that interconnected regions over vast expanse as demonstrated by direct measurements of solar system space plasmas ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
