    "snippet" : "\"Consider the quest for gravitational waves: for quarter of a century the favoured method has been to hang up a large lump of something heavy and wait for it to go 'ping' because of something going on at the other end of the universe.  As time goes by the mass is put in increasingly inaccessible and vibration free places and is made increasingly denser, larger, and of course, costlier.  The engineers are cajoled to devise instruments to measure more and more delicate vibrations, but they might just as well be asked to measure the beating of an angel's wings.\"\n\n- Prof. John Billingsley",
