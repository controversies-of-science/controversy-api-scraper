Space Sci., Vol. 23, p.261, 1973.\n\nA particularly revealing statement appeared on one of the Internet sites of the prestigious Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. [96]\n\n'Magnetic reconnection (henceforth called 'reconnection') refers to the breaking and reconnecting of oppositely directed magnetic field lines in a plasma. In the process, magnetic field energy is converted to plasma kinetic and thermal energy.\n\nIn plasma physics, it is well known that magnetic field lines are 'frozen-in' to an infinitely conductive plasma. Since charged plasma particles are confined to circular orbits around magnetic field lines, this means that infinitely conductive plasmas will not diffuse across field lines and mix. Conversely, two distinct field lines will remain separate since they cannot penetrate the intervening plasma ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
