Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 14, No. 3, 2000, p.449\n\n\"Obviously, gravity acts much faster than the speed of light; otherwise, the earth would be orbiting around a point where the Sun was 8 minutes ago. But in the simplified pantheon of scientific saints, Einstein said that information cannot be communicated faster than the speed of light. So he resorted to having masses curve space. Bodies ran on invisible, prefixed tracks in space, but how can you curve nothing?\"",
