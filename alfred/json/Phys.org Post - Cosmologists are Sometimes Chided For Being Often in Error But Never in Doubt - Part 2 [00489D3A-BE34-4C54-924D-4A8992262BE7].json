I should emphasize very strongly that my 99 percent confidence extends back to one second -- perhaps even to a millisecond -- but certainly not much farther back than that. This limit arises because a backward extrapolation into the first tiny fraction of a second leads to densities and temperatures far higher than can be reproduced or studied on Earth, so we have no firm basis for any inferences.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.83-84",
