Note also that Eddington’s two plates contained an insufficient number of undisplaced stars from which to make the necessary adjustments for error (five rather than six).\n\nThen factor in the large standard deviation in the results that he accepted (rendering most of the results either too high or too low), and one can understand why Earman and Glymour concluded in their 1980 article, ‘the eclipse expeditions confirmed the theory [of Einstein] only if part of the observations were thrown out and the discrepancies in the remainder ignored’. In short, they didn’t. \n\nA core principle of the standard model of the scientific method is that theoretical predictions should not be allowed to influence which results are used and which are discarded. In Eddington’s approach, however, [...] predictions and data interpretation became mutually confirming. Eddington evaluated his results according to how they conformed to his preferred theoretical predictions ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
