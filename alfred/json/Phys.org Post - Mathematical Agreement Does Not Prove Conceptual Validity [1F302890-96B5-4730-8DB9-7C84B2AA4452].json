It does not prove conceptual validity; it merely establishes the fact that this particular conceptual explanation could be correct, and it leaves open the possibility that the correct explanation is contained in some other hypothesis that is mathematically equivalent to the one in question. There may well be many such.\"\n\n- Dewey B. Larson, New Light on Space & Time",
