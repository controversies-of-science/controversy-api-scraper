    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"(ii) In cosmic space, where heat energy can be radiated away as fast as it tends to build up, the process of collecting gases to form a stellar body (if that is indeed the formative process of a star) is more likely to be an isothermal than an adiabatic process (in which compression would tend to heat central regions more than outer regions and produce a hot core); therefore, if one is not predisposed to account for high central temperatures, one need not assume they are generated by star-formation.\n\n(iii) A theorem developed by A. Ritter (1882), cited in support of the notion that a gaseous star in gravitational equilibrium must have high central temperatures, is not up to the task; what Ritter really demonstrated is that, if a star is a gaseous body, and if it is not isothermal, then its mean temperature must range in the millions of degrees. (The concept of mean temperature, of course, does not apply to an isothermal body.)\"\n\n(cont'd)",
