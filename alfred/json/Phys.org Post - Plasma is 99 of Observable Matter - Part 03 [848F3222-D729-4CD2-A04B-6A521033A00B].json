It is an interesting fact that most of the material in the visible universe, as much as 99% according to some estimates, is in the plasma state.  This includes the Sun, most stars, and a significant fraction of the interstellar medium. Thus, plasmas play a major role in the universe. Plasma physics is relevant to the formation of planetary radiation belts, the development of sunspots and solar flares, the acceleration of high velocity winds that flow outward from the Sun and other stars, the generation of radio emissions from the Sun and other astrophysical objects, and the acceleration of cosmic rays.\"",
