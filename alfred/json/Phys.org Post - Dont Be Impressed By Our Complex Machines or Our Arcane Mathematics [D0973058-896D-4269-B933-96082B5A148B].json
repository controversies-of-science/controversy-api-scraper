    "snippet" : "\"It is not likely that we primates gazing through bits of glass for a century or two will dissemble the architecture and history of infinity. But if we don't try we won't get anywhere. Therefore we professionals do the best we can to fit the odd clues we have into some kind of plausible story. That is how science works, and that is the spirit in which our cosmological speculations should be treated. Don't be impressed by our complex machines or our arcane mathematics. They have been used to build plausible cosmic stories before -- which we had to discard afterwards in the face of improving evidence. The likelihood must be that such revisions will have to occur again and again and again.\"\n\n- Mike Disney, The Case against Cosmology, arXiv:astro-ph\/0009020 v1 1 Sep.2000",
