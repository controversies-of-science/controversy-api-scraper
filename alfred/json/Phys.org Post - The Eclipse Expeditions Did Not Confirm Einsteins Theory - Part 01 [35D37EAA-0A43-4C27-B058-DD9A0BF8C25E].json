    "snippet" : "Fabulous Science Fact and Fiction in the History of Scientific Discovery\nJohn Waller\n(p57-63)\n\n\"Eddington began by casting doubt on the scores obtained by the Sobral team. He claimed that their astrographic results were not randomly distributed around the mean score as one would expect with normal data points. Instead, they were mostly beneath it, suggesting that a 'systematic error' had occurred that had artificially lowered the mean score itself. Without this error, he implied, their results would also have approximated to the higher Einsteinian prediction. This was a reasonable argument.  The problem was Eddington's abject inability to show that the same error had not occurred in the other data-sets. When challenged, he produced not a single piece of unambiguous evidence to demonstrate that the measurements he accepted were unaffected by the same error ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
