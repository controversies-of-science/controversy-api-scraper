    "snippet" : "\"Falsifiability is the first example of a strategy, or general principle, for reducing the number of models. It is probably the most widely discussed demarcation criterion and shows at once that asserting a scientific theory is equivalent to denying alternatives. Popper listed two other criteria besides falsifiability. Firstly, a good, new theory should, 'proceed from some simple, new, and powerful unifying idea,' (Conjectures and Refutations). It should, in principle, be able to unify a body of knowledge that would otherwise be a set of disparate facts. Secondly, Popper held that it should pass some tests. A good new theory should make at least one successful prediction not apparent from existing theory.\"\n\n- John Hewitt, A Habit of Lies",
