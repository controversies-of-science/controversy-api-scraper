Any method is legitimate to achieve useful connections, including fusion, juxtaposition, analogies, integration, synthesis, and whatever else might work ... Typically, attempts at unification have been sparked by analogies, whether consciously or not. At various times, the universe has been viewed as an army of gods, an organism, a machine, a clock, and more. For those steeped in physics, it could be a mechanism, a timepiece, or a computer. Even though such analogies are normally purged from scholarly discourse and official presentations, they often haunt our thoughts.\"",
