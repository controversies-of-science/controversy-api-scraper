    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Venus was accorded a feminine nature by various peoples of Central and South America as well.  Among the Zinacenteco Indians of Mesoamerica, Venus was envisaged as a girl sweeping the path of the sun. [16] The Chamacoco of Paraguay perceived in the planet a beautiful woman named Johle. [17] The Warraus tribe of the Pomeroon knew Venus as Okona-kura.  Of this goddess they told the following story: 'She it was who stuck in the hole when her people first came down from above the skies to populate the earth.' [18]\"\n\n[16] See E.
