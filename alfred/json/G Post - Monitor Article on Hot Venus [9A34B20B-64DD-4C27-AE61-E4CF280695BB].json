    "snippet" : "\"The mystery of Venus' internal heat\", Nov. 13 1980 issue of _New Scientist_\n\n_*\"Two years' surveillance by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter seems to show that Venus is radiating away more energy than it receives from the Sun.*  If this surprising result is confirmed, it means that the planet itself is producing far more heat than the Earth does._\n\n_F.W. Taylor, of the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford, presented these measurements at the Royal Society meeting last week.  Venus's surface temperature is higher than any other in the solar system, at 480 C.  The generally accepted theory is that sunlight is absorbed at Venus's surface, and re-radiated as infrared.  The latter is absorbed in the atmosphere, which thus acts as a blanket keeping the planet hot.  It is similar to the way a greenhouse keeps warm._\n\n_Pioneer has shown that there is enough carbon dioxide (and the tiny proportion of water vapour) needed to make the greenhouse effect work -- just.  *If this is the whole story, the total amount of radiation emitted back into space, after its journey up through the atmospheric blanket, must be exactly equal to that absorbed from sunlight (otherwise the surface temperature would be continuously changing).*_\n\n_*But Taylor found that Venus radiates 15 per cent more energy than it receives.  To keep the surface temperature constant, Venus must be producing this extra heat from within.*_\n\n_All the inner planets, including the Earth, produce internal heat from radioactive elements in their rocks.  But Taylor's observations of Venus would mean that the planet is producing almost *10,000 times more heat than the Earth* -- and it is inconceivable, according to present theories of planetary formation, that Venus should have thousands of times more of the radioactive elements than the Earth does.  At last week's meeting, Taylor's suggestion met with scepticism -- not to say sheer disbelief -- from other planetary scientists._\n\n_*Taylor himself has no explanation for his result.  He simply points out that the discrepancy seemed at first to be simply experimental error -- but with more precise measurement it refused to go away.*  More measurements are needed before astronomers accept the result, and *most planetary scientists are obviously expecting -- and hoping -- that the embarrassing extra heat will disappear on further investigation.\"*_",
