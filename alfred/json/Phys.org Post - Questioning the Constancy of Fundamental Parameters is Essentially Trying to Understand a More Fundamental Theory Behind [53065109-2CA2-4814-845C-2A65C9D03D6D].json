García-Berro et al., Astronomical measurements and constraints on the variability of fundamental constants, Astron Astrophys Rev (2007) 14:113–170\n\n\"The issue of the level of 'fundamentality' of a given coupling or parameter is not a simple question. The status of a coupling depends on the theory considered, namely whether it is effective or 'fundamental' (microscopic). Some of the 'fundamental' couplings of a large-scale (effective) theory remain to be fundamental in the underlying microscopic theory, others do not. A pragmatic approach is to fix a theoretical framework characterized by a set of known parameters and then pose questions like why the parameters have the values they do really have and whether they are constants. Thus, questioning the constancy of fundamental parameters is essentially trying to understand a more fundamental theory behind.\"",
