Astrophys. 1982. 20, pp.16-7\n\n\"Nowadays the school population reaches the age of college entrance in a considerable measure unable to read efficiently and insecure in elementary mathematical processes.\n\nThere was none of this in the old days of rote-learning, preferably done by chanting. Well-proven techniques acquired by chanting stood their recipients in good stead for a whole lifetime. And the higher the standard one seeks to achieve, the more necessary does rote-learning become. The situation is the same in mathematics and science as it is in learning a musical instrument, or learning to play difficult parts like Macbeth and King Lear on the stage. The golden rule is to learn the lines, or the scales, or the mathematical processes, to a point where they can be reproduced with extreme facility. Only then should one worry seriously about meanings and interpretations.\"",
