    "snippet" : "Arthur Lynch, The Case Against Einstein, Dodd, Mead & Co., New York, 1933\n\n\"It is difficult, as a rule, to obtain the insertion in a newspaper of a scientific article, and even when, on State occasions, the papers give some space to science they either invest the news with something that enhances it -- the patronage of science by a titled person -- or they add something astonishing, or fantastic, to eke out the news. The same difficulty arises with any reasoned form of philosophy. If it reaches sane conclusions it passes into the light of common day, and ceases to be of interest; but if it asserts that a young man in Cambridge has created life in a test tube, whereas he has simply mistaken objects under his microscope, then a wave of enthusiasm traverses the world; and devout people, whose chief beliefs would be jeopardised by this discovery, are loudest in their hymns at the wonder.\"",
