Peratt, New Beginnings: Creating the Universe Without the Big Bang, The Sciences, Jan\/Feb 1990, p.29\n\n\"All laboratory simulations incorporate a model of plasma filament interaction, based on observations of many space plasmas such as the aurora, solar prominences and the Jupiter-Io flux tube. Whenever an intense Birkeland current is flowing, instabilities develop along its length; at these points small electric fields appear. The electric fields accelerate electrons to high energies, thereby producing a current that pinches the plasma into small whirlpools. Adjacent filaments tend to be pulled together at these points, and where they cross, the individual whirlpools combine into larger spirals ... plasma spirals periodically dot the length of long laboratory filaments.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
