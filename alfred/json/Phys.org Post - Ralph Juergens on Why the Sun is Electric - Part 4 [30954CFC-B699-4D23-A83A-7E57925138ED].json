    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"(iv) A theorem given top billing in modern discussions of why a star must be characterized by thermonuclear reactions in its core -- the virial theorem -- 'tells us,' according to Jeans, 'that, if the sun is gaseous, the total energy of motion of all its molecules or other [component particles], is 3 x 1048 ergs;' from which one can only conclude that the central temperature is high enough to liberate thermonuclear energy. But the virial theorem assumes that the particles in question are moving under no forces except their own mutual gravitational attractions, which seems a curious condition to impose on a gas, defined as an assemblage of particles influenced almost entirely by elastic forces arising from mutual collisions. Also, the theorem fails to even consider electrostatic and electromagnetic forces.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
