They are, thus, almost by definition, the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe. And since the general theory of relativity provides a single unique two-parameter family of solutions for their descriptions, they are the simplest objects as well ... The mathematical theory of black holes is a subject of immense complexity. But its study has convinced me of the basic truth of the ancient mottoes, 'The simple is the seal of the true' and 'Beauty is the splendour of truth.'\"",
