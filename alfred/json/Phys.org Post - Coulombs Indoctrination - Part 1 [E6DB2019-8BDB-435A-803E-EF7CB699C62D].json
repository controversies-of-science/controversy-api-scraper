    "snippet" : "The Electric Life of Michael Faraday by Alan Hirshfeld, p.73\n\n\"On October 1, 1820, Humphrey Davy swept into the laboratory of the Royal Institution with remarkable news for Michael Faraday. While performing a demonstration before a science class, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted had noticed that an electrical current flowing in a wire moved a nearby magnetic compass needle. Whenever Oersted brought the compass toward the wire, something wrested the needle from its tenuous alignment with the earth's magnetic field and swung it in a different direction. Evidently, current in a wire creates its own halo of force -- later proved to be a magnetic field, not from an ordinary magnet, but from an electrical impostor ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
