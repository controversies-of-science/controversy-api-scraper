    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Big-bang cosmology is a form of religious fundamentalism, as is the furor over black holes, and this is why these peculiar states of mind have flourished so strongly over the past quarter century. It is in the nature of fundamentalism that it should contain a powerful streak of irrationality and that it should not relate, in a verifiable, practical way, to the everyday world. It is also necessary for a fundamentalist belief that it should permit the emergence of gurus, whose pronouncements can be widely reported and pondered on endlessly -- endlessly for the reason that they contain nothing of substance, so that it would take an eternity of time to distil even one drop of sense from them. Big-bang cosmology refers to an epoch that cannot be reached by any form of astronomy, and, in more than two decades, it has not produced a single successful prediction.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
