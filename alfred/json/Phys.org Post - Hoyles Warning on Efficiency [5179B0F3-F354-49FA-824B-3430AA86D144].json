    "snippet" : "Fred Hoyle, Of Men and Galaxies, p.24\n\n\"Beware of efficiency. Remember that Einstein was generally regarded as a vague impractical man ... It seems to be characteristic of all great work, in every field, that it arises spontaneously and unpretentiously, and that its creators wear a cloak of imprecision ... The man who voyages strange seas must of necessity be a little unsure of himself. It is the man with the flashy air of knowing everything, who is always on the ball, always with it, that we should beware of. It will not be long now before his behavior can be imitated quite perfectly by a computer.\"",
