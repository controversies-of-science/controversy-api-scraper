Peratt, New Beginnings: Creating the Universe Without the Big Bang, The Sciences, Jan\/Feb 1990, p.29\n\n\"Thirty years of space research has revealed the solar system to be a veritable sea of plasma, invisible to optical telescopes yet traversed by complex, interacting electric and magnetic fields. Do plasma phenomena abruptly cease at the threshold of the solar system? Alfv√©n, who won the 1970 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on plasmas, argues to the contrary. He has suggested that Birkeland currents of unlimited size might be found throughout the universe. After all, why should plasma physics operate any differently at the far end of the cosmos, ten billion light-years away, than it does in the Earth's magnetosphere or in laboratories on the Earth's surface?\"",
