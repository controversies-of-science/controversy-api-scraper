    "snippet" : "Hannes Alfv√©n, Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Vol. PS-14, No. 6, December 1986, p.5\n\n\"The interest in double layers made a great leap forward when Langmuir began his investigations. He introduced the term 'plasma' in his paper 'Oscillation in Ionized Gases' (Langmuir and Tonks, 1929a; see also Langmuir and Tonks, 1929b). Curiously enough, he does not give any motivation for choosing this word, which was probably borrowed from medical terminology. He just states: 'We shall use the name 'plasma' to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.' His biographers do not give any explanation either. Langmuir also made the first detailed analyses of double layers (Langmuir, 1929).\"",
