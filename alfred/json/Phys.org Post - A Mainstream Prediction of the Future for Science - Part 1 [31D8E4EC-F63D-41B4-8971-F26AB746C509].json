    "snippet" : "\"Over the next decade we will be able to trace our origins, from the quantum fluctuations that seeded galaxies in the infant universe, to the origin of atoms and dark matter, to the first stars and galaxies, and to the formation of planetary systems like ours. We are also primed to understand how the most exotic objects in the universe work, including supermassive black holes and neutron stars, as well as to figure out how planetary systems form, how common are planets in the habitable zone around stars, and how to find evidence for life elsewhere.\n\nDuring the decade we will push the frontiers of basic knowledge, using the universe as a laboratory to identify the exotic dark matter and understand the even more mysterious dark energy, probe the basic properties of neutrinos and determine how they shaped the universe, and test whether or not Einstein's theory of gravity fully describes black holes ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
