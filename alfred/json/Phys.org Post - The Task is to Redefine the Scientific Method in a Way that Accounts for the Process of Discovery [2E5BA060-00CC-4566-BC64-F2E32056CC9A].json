Root-Bernstein, Setting the Stage for Discovery, The Sciences, May\/June 1988\n\n\"Why not admit that discoveries derive from the ways in which particular scientists logically go about their work? Then, given that different scientists practice different styles of research, and that not all of them make discoveries, it should be possible to identify the styles that most often pay off. Surely, any mental activity that contributes directly to scientific discoveries should be recognized as scientific method. If such activities are not acknowledged by the prevailing view of how scientists use logic and reason, that does not mean the activities are illogical. It means that the prevailing view is too narrow to account for how scientists really think. The task, then, is to redefine the scientific method in a way that accounts for the process of discovery.\"",
