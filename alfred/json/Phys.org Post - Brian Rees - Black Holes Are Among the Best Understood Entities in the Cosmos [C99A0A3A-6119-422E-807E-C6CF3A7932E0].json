    "snippet" : "\"Black holes are among the most exotic entities in the cosmos. But they are actually among the best understood. They are constructed from the fabric of space itself and are as simple in structure as elementary particles. A newly formed black hole quickly settles down to a standardized stationary state characterized by just two numbers: those that measure its mass and its spin. (In principle, electric charge is a third such number, but stars can never acquire enough electric charge for this factor to be relevant to real collapses.) The distorted space and time around black holes is described exactly by a solution of Einstein's general relativity equations that was first discovered in 1963 by Roy Kerr, a mathematician who later forsook research to become an internationally recognized bridge player.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.89",
