    "snippet" : "Fabulous Science Fact and Fiction in the History of Scientific Discovery\nJohn Waller\n(p127)\n\n\"Over the past few decades there has been a general realization that scientists rarely look at nature without having a theory to guide them. This is mostly because the external world is bewilderingly complex. A mind incapable of imposing preconceived ideas onto what it observes will soon implode under the pressure of sensory overload. In the jargon of the philosophy of science, our perception of natural phenomena is ‘theory-laden’, and cannot be otherwise. The only alternative to the despotism of preconceived ideas is, in nearly all cases, an anarchic haze of disconnected thoughts and impressions. Theories also play an essential part in making linkages between seemingly disparate observations. Without a theoretical framework within which to make sense of them, many crucial facts seem isolated and unimportant.\"",
