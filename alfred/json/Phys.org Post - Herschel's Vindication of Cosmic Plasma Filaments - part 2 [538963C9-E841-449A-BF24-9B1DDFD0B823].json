These are all topics which are time and time again discussed on holoscience.com by Wal Thornhill.\n\nWhen I pointed these things out, the response here was that there was no indication that these filaments were plasmas conducting currents -- the implication being that we should not look to possible claims of mistakes in the textbooks, nor to the universe's most common state for matter as an explanation.",
