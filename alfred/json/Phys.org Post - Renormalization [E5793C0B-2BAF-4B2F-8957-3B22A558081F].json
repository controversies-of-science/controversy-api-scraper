Hotson, Dirac's Equation and the Sea of Negative Energy, Infinite Energy, Issue 43, 2002, p.1-20\n\nFeynman, who originated the 'renormalization' process (with Schwinger and Tomonaga), himself called it a '... shell game ... Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-consistent ...
