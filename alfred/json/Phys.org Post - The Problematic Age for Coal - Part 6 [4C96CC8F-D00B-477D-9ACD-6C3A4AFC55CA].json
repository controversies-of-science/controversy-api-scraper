And because other coal seams are found on top of this sandy deposit, it has been reasoned that the sand acted as the soil on which a new forest grew and thrived before it, too, suffered the same fate as the previous one.\n\nMarine fossils are often found embedded in the layers between coal seams [1].  An incursion of the sea is then blamed for these deposits but, because coal was then again formed on top of them, the sea must again have retreated.  The problem here is that in certain areas as much as 400 coal seams have been found interspersed between other layers of sedimentation.  This, then, would mean that the sea must have inundated the land and again retreated that many times.  And each time, of course, a forest would have to have grown in the very same area.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
