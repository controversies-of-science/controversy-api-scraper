    "snippet" : "\"In addition to the direct evidence against the conceptual validity of the Special Theory which is supplied by the clock paradox and the existence of absolute acceleration, the inability of the adherents of this theory to extend its field of applicability or to establish firm connections with other physical theories, in spite of the immense amount of effort devoted to the task is, in a sense, additional direct evidence against it, because non-uniform motion is so closely related to uniform motion that a conceptually valid theory applicable to the more limited field should be capable of extension to the general case without any serious difficulty. We must therefore conclude that the conceptual validity of the Special Theory is not only unproved but definitely disproved.\"\n\n- Dewey B. Larson, New Light on Space & Time",
