    "snippet" : "\"Superstring theory cannot yet account for various types of subatomic particles -- quarks, gluons, and so forth -- nor has it yet predicted something new, experimental or cosmological, caused by the extra dimensions. But many are already willing to bet on it partly because it almost seems to 'predict' that a force like gravity should exist, but partly also for aesthetic reasons.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.152",
