Above all I am concerned by an apparent loss of contact with empirical evidence and observational facts, and, worse, by a deliberate refusal on the part of some theorists to accept such results when they appear to be in conflict with some of the oversimplified and therefore intellectually appealing theories of the universe.\"\n\n- Gérard de Vaucouleurs (1918–1995)",
