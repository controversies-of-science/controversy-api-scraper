Rantsev-Kartinov\n\n\"Multilevel dynamical contrasting of cosmic dust cloud images reveals the presence of skeletal-like structures that are similar to those found in various electrical discharges and in space plasmas. These results, which are concentric cylinders in interstellar space, corroborate the discovery of interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) emission spectra that are recorded in radio astronomy from low- and high-velocity intergalactic clouds in which the critical ionization velocity effect plays a role in the formation of coaxial or twisted plasma filaments. The nanodust assembled 'skeletons' are similar to that observed by Voyager 1 images of solar system planets that show the filaments aligned perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.\"",
