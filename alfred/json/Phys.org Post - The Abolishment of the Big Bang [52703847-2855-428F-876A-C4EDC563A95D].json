Mayer, On the Geometry of Time in Physics and Cosmology and the fall of the canonical cosmological model, p.136\n\n\"The abolishment of the Big Bang cosmological paradigm and the scientific recognition of an eternal Universe will likely initiate some kind of 21st-century global cultural transformation, similar to that which occurred in the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. We now think of the Universe as evolving over time, so what does it mean for ontology when scientific theory supported by empirical evidence implies that the Cosmic Process has occurred over an infinite amount of time? Perhaps it will become palatable for many in the scientific community to begin to believe and to teach that we live in a purposeful and participatory Universe as mystics throughout history have asserted, among them both Johannes Kepler, the author of Concerning the More Certain Fundamentals of Astrology (1602), and Isaac Newton, the devoted alchemist.\"",
