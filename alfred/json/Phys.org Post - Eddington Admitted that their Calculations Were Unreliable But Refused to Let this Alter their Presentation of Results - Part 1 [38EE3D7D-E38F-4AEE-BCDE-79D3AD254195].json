    "snippet" : "Fabulous Science Fact and Fiction in the History of Scientific Discovery\nJohn Waller\n(p56)\n\n\"From the usable Principe plates, Eddington calculated a star-beam displacement of between 1.31 and 1.91 seconds. But even these plates were of embarrassingly poor quality and it has been suggested that the mathematical formula he used to reach these figures was in itself biased ...\n\nSelf-evidently, with such poor and contradictory evidence, attempting a resolution of the controversy on the basis of these figures was an extremely risky affair. Take just one of the hazards mentioned above: atmospheric turbulence. In the hot environments in which both teams were working it was likely that all but the largest displacements would be cancelled out by this phenomenon ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
