Does this merely reflect the lack of power of our computers? or does it imply some more fundamental barrier? ... During a meeting ... in 1983, AJ Leggett argued 'I would challenge anyone in this room to prove Ohm’s law rigorously for a real sample, from the laws of atomic theory and electromagnetism.'\"",
