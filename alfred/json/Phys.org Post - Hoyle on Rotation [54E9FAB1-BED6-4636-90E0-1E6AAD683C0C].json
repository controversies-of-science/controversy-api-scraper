    "snippet" : "Hoyle, Burbidge & Narlikar, A Different Approach to Cosmology, p.321-322\n\n\"As far as we are aware, all astronomical bodies are rotating. Their angular momentum must be related to their origin and interactions ... If galaxies and other condensed objects are ejected from dense configurations as we have proposed, the angular momentum must arise from the relative motions of different parts of an ejected object, but we understand little of how this has taken place.\n\nRelated to this general problem, we also have the difficulty of understanding how objects which are formed by gravitational collapse and condensation, i.e. normal stars, manage to get rid of large amounts of angular momentum which they clearly must do ... In our view the angular momentum problem on the cosmological scale is clearly related to the problem of the origin of magnetic fields in the universe, but it is not yet understood.\"",
