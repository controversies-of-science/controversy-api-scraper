That may be one of the reasons that many scientists who used to be uniformitarians are now catastrophists.  At one time people felt good at living in a non-threatening environment where global catastrophes were only myths.  Scientists who supported this idea received government grants (read your tax money) to continue the research to prove that model.  When funding for uniformity became catastrophically lower, scientists needed to produce a major threat that needed government funds to be investigated.  The best threat around was external bodies colliding with Earth.  A new look at the old evidence provided just the proof needed to scare enough people to create some funding.  The need for money is a strong influence in the ability to shift paradigms, even when the shift is toward a more correct model.\"",
