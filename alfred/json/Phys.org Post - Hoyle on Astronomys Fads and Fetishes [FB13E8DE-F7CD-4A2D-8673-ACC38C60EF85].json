    "snippet" : "Fred Hoyle, Home is where the wind blows, p.280\n\n\"... astronomy is a subject of fads and fetishes. In 1953, the fad was plasma oscillations. In 1936-1939, when I had begun research, it had been radiation pressure. Then it was turbulence, then magnetic fields, and now plasma oscillations. In the future, it would be black holes, accretion disks, and gravitational lenses. There is a close psychological connection between these fads and children's games. A game is 'in' one moment and totally 'out' sometime later. Astronomical fads have always involved miracle working to some degree, and their discussion in so-called workshops and in the streams of papers that pour into the journals have affinities to the incantations of Macbeth's witches on the blasted heath.\"",
