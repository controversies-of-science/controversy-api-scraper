    "snippet" : "\"It was Sigmund Freud who wrote in The Scientific Literature of Dream-Problems (up to 1900) about reviews of his work, The Interpretation of Dreams, that they 'have thus afforded a brilliant example of the aversion to learning anything new so characteristic of the scientist. 'Les savants ne sont pas curieux', said the scoffer, Anatole France ... The few reviews which have appeared in the scientific journals are so full of misconceptions and lack of comprehension that my only possible answer to my critics would be a request that they should read this book over again -- or perhaps merely that they should read it!'' This kind of reaction seems common in science when disciplinary boundaries are crossed.\"\n\n- Anatole France (Anatole-Fran√ßois Thibaut, 1844-1924)",
