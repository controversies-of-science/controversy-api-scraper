These potentials are not directly observable quantities. For one thing, Maxwell's equations do not determine them absolutely; only differences in potential matter. One can arbitrarily change the reference of the potential, or its 'zero-point' as it is often called, without in any way affecting the laws of physics. Such modifications of the potential are referred to as 'gauge transformations.'\"",
