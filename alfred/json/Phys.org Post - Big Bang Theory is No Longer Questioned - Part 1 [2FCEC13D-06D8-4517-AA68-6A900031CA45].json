    "snippet" : "The Cult of the Big Bang: Was There a Bang?\nWilliam C Mitchell\n(p167)\n\n\"The primary undesirable result of the fraternization of [Big Bang Theory] cosmologists is that it has resulted in special efforts to support [Big Bang Theory] at the expense of possible alternate cosmologies ...\n\nSince the invention of the [Big Bang] cosmologists have spent untold effort to overcome its many problems.  In that struggle a great variety of innovations have been attempted and, in many cases, biased efforts made to find confirming evidence and compatible explanations while contrary evidence is ignored.  Each bit of data and logic that might discredit [Big Bang Theory] is customarily overlooked or passed off as inconsequential.\n\nBecause the validity of basic [Big Bang Theory] is considered by all but a few within the cosmological community to be a virtual proven fact, this breach of scientific method hasn't received any noticeable degree of comment.\"",
