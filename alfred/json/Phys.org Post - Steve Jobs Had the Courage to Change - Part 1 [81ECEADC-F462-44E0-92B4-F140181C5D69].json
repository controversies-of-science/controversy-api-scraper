It was a good-looking piece of hardware, but it flopped so hard that Apple discontinued it after a year.\n\nIn a talk at Oxford, Apple CEO Tim Cook reflected on the 'spectacular failure commercially' of the Cube, and what he learned from his mentor Steve Jobs about failure amid the whole experience.\n\n'It was a very important product for us, we put a lot of love into it, we put enormous engineering into it,' Cook said of the G4 Cube on stage. He calls it an 'engineering marvel.' At the time, Cook was Apple Senior VP of Worldwide Operations, recruited personally by then-CEO Steve Jobs.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
