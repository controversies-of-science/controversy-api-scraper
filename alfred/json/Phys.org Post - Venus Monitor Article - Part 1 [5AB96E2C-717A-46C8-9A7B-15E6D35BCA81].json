    "snippet" : "\"The mystery of Venus' internal heat\", Nov. 13 1980 issue of _New Scientist_\n\n\"Two years' surveillance by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter seems to show that Venus is radiating away more energy than it receives from the Sun.  If this surprising result is confirmed, it means that the planet itself is producing far more heat than the Earth does.\n\nF.W. Taylor, of the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford, presented these measurements at the Royal Society meeting last week.  Venus's surface temperature is higher than any other in the solar system, at 480 C.  The generally accepted theory is that sunlight is absorbed at Venus's surface, and re-radiated as infrared.  The latter is absorbed in the atmosphere, which thus acts as a blanket keeping the planet hot.  It is similar to the way a greenhouse keeps warm ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
