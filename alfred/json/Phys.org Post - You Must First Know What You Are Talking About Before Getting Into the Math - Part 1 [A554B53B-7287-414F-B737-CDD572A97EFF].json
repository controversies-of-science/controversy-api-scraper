    "snippet" : "Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony, Lewis Thomas, p.143-144\n\n\"On one occasion, Kelvin made a speech on the overarching importance of numbers.  He maintained that no observation of nature was worth paying serious attention to unless it could be stated in precisely quantitative terms.  The numbers were the final and only test, not only of truth but about meaning as well.  He said, 'When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it.  But when you cannot -- your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind.'\"\n\n(cont'd)",
