N., Reflections on Macrophysics and the Sun, Solar Physics 176: 1997, p.219-247\n\n\"It is essential in these exuberant times to pay critical attention to both the observational constraints and to the basic mathematical laws, with a clear sense of what is solid theory and what is only unsupported speculation. This seeming platitude is offered here without jest, because at the present time there are 'theories' –- scenarios sometimes quite detailed –- seriously and often passionately held, for almost every exotic astronomical object that is not resolved in the telescope. In contrast, the one star that can be properly resolved –- the pedestrian Sun (cf., Goldberg, 1953; Strömgren, 1953) -– exhibits a variety of phenomena that defy contemporary theoretical understanding.\"",
