    "snippet" : "\"Many scientists pay close attention to their leading men who are building upon 'realities' but ignore their philosophers of scientific method who warn them not to arrogate 'The Truth\" to themselves. When their raft begins to leak, then, they must tolerate the effects of presumption: mistrust, disbelief, and annoying criticism. And they may not solve some problems that they have set their hearts upon solving.\"\n\n- Alfred de Grazia, London, May 1, 1980",
