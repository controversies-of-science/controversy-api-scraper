    "snippet" : "Concepts of Mass in Classical and Modern Physics, Max Jammer, Harvard University Press, 1961, p.224\n\n\"One has to admit that in spite of the concerted effort of physicists and philosophers, mathematicians and logicians, no final clarification of the concept of mass has been reached.\n\nThe modern physicist may rightfully be proud of his spectacular achievements in science and technology. However, he should always be aware that the foundations of his imposing edifice, the basic notions of his discipline, such as the concept of mass, are entangled with serious uncertainties and perplexing difficulties that have as yet not been resolved.\"",
