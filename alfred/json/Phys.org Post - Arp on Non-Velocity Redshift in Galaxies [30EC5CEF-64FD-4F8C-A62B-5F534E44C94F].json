The answer to this may be even more far-reaching and staggering than the answer to the same question about quasars. And, if the more energetic, compact forms of galaxies can be shown to be physically continuous with quasars then the answer to the redshift riddle for quasars may be the same for quasars as for galaxies.\"",
