Physics itself interested me, learning why things happen as they do -- mathematics was merely a tool to understand and test the underlying physical concepts. That was not the way physics was taught; instead, mathematical techniques were emphasized. This is almost exclusively what students are still tested on, and obviously what they study the most.\n\nI went on to graduate work in physics at the University of Maryland, intending to get a doctorate. But after a year, I left. I couldn't reconcile myself with the mathematical approach, which seemed sterile and abstract -- especially in particle physics, in which I had considered specializing ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
