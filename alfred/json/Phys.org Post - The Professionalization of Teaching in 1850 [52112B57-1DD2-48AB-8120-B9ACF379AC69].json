    "snippet" : "\"The professionalisation of teaching in around 1850, and the merging of research with teaching, set the stage for the inevitable ossification of science a century later. The professional cannot afford to allow knowledge to advance. Any attempt to push forward the bounds of knowledge by paying professionals to do so must fail. Even when employed specifically to advance knowledge, the professional will freeze it. The existing knowledge base is the professional's identity, his security, and his income. New knowledge threatens all of these.\"\n\n- Ivor Catt http:\/\/www.ivor.com\/28anom.htm",
