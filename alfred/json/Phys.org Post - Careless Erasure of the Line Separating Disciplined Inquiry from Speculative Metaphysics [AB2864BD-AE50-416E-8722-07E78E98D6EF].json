    "snippet" : "\"Until recently, the great physicists have been scrupulous about honoring the terms of their contract [to provide a true account of the physical world].  They have attempted with dignity to respect the distinction between what is known and what is not ... This scrupulousness has lately been compromised.  The result has been the calculated or careless erasure of the line separating disciplined physical inquiry from speculative metaphysics.  Contemporary cosmologists feel free to say anything that pops into their heads.\"\n\n- David Berlinski, Was There a Big Bang? Discovery Institute, January 1, 1998",
