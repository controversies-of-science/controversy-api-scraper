    "snippet" : "\"The now mainstream idea of an expanding Universe rests on the rash assumption that the observed cosmological redshift is indicative of a related recessional motion of the galaxies. One seemingly reasonable assumption led to a series of other invented ideas, each needed to justify the prior, until there is now an entire belief system of unreasonable ad hoc ideas, each more unlikely than the last, culminating in 'dark energy'. In contrast, physicist Howard Burton of the Perimeter Institute in Canada has written,\n\n'The pursuit of beauty and elegance has always been a driving force in the development of scientific theories. To its most radical proponents, this bias is based on a firm, axiomatic belief that, at its core, nature simply must be beautiful.'\n\nOne may add the corollary that nature must be simple, beautifully.\"\n\n- Alexander F. Mayer, On the Geometry of Time in Physics and Cosmology and the fall of the canonical cosmological model",
