A major theoretical difficulty is that both coronal heating and wind production depend fundamentally on the heat flux, and the solar atmosphere is not collisional enough for classical transport theory to hold. Heat transport thus behaves non-classically and the particle velocity distributions may have significant high energy tails, which should dramatically affect coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, in a way that is outside the scope of standard MHD.\"",
