    "snippet" : "\"Many serious physicists -- perhaps the majority -- have concluded, based on quantum mechanics, that the phenomena of subatomic physics have 'refuted reality' altogether. But if one believes that reality does not exist, or that it is irrelevant to physics, or that physical effects arise from nothing, or whatever else might be meant by the claim to have 'refuted reality', one cannot claim to be a physicist. Reality is the subject matter of physics. That quantum mechanics has reached the point of such absurdity as to deny the very existence of its own subject matter plainly shows that something is profoundly wrong with this theory. Reasonable scientists can no longer refuse to accept this obvious conclusion.\"\n\n- Lewis E. Little, The Theory of Elementary Waves - A Causal Explanation of Quantum Phenomena.",
