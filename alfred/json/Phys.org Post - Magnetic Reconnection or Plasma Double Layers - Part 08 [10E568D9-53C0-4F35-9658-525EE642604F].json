When more or less oppositely pointing field lines approach each other, they can abruptly short-circuit or 'reconnect,' ... In the new reconnected configuration, the field lines are bent tightly like the elastic strings of a catapult.  When the field lines suddenly straighten, they fling out plasma ... in opposite directions.'\n\n(Don Scott continues ...)\n\nThere is nothing unusual about [these conditions].  This configuration occurs regularly ...\n\nThe field's weakest value (zero) occurs precisely at the central saddle point.  At this point the current on the right is producing a vertically upward magnetic field and the current on the left is producing an equal strength downward field.  These two oppositely directed equal strength fields simply cancel each other out ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
