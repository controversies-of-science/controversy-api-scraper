The Suppressed Electrodynamics of Ampère-Gauss-Weber, Spring 2001 editorial of 21st Century Science & Technology\n\n\"An iron curtain divides the subjects of gravity and electrodynamics, in today’s academically accepted versions of physics. Those attempting to cross it will risk the intellectual equivalent of machine-gun fire ... If the real history of physics of the 19th century were known, most of what passes as teaching of fundamental topics in that discipline today, would be shown to be, in the best of cases, misdirected, in the worst, willful fraud.\"",
