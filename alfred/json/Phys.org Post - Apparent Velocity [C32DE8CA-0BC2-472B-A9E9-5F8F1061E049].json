    "snippet" : "\"The field is new, but it offers rather definite prospects not only of testing the form of the velocity-distance relation beyond the reach of the spectrograph, but even of critically testing the very interpretation of red-shifts as due to motion. With this possibility in view, the cautious observer refrains from committing himself to the present interpretation and prefers the colourless term 'apparent velocity.'\"\n\n- Edwin Hubble, 1934 lecture \"Red-Shifts in the Spectra of Nebulae\"",
