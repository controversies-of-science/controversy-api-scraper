    "snippet" : "\"Those who regard philosophy as a 'soft' and unscientific discipline, in contrast to the 'hard' and scientific fields of mathematics and physics, have accepted a Big Lie. The ideas of mathematicians and physicists can be no more objective or certain than the philosophic ideas on which they depend. Philosophy is the discipline that tells us how to be objective and how to achieve certainty. Without a theory of knowledge, how would mathematicians or physicists know the relationship of their concepts and generalizations to reality? It is the inductive science of philosophy that teaches the 'hard' scientist how to be scientific.\"\n\n- Leonard Peikoff, The Logical Leap, 2010, p.242-243",
