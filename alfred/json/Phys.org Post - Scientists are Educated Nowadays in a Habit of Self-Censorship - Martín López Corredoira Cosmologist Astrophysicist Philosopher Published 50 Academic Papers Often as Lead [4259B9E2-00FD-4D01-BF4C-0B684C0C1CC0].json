    "snippet" : "The Twilight of the Scientific Age\n\n\"Scientists are educated nowadays in a habit of self-censorship. The system promotes self-repression in the spread of ideas, so most scientists, when writing a paper, think something like 'I think this and that, but I cannot say so in my paper because this will not pass the referee's control, so I will not say it'. This causes serious harm to creativity among people who dare to think new things.\"\n\n\"scientists have to choose between developing their own ideas freely or being constrained by subjects which allow academic success.\"",
