    "snippet" : "\"Basil Bernstein was the first to point out that knowledge is property with its own market value and trading relationships, to be defended by the group who administer that body of knowledge. Today, each group of knowledge Barons defends his demesne, his body of archaic knowledge, by the cynical use of spurious pseudo-philosophical double-talk and double-think; wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle and the rest. This is the way Science ends. This is the way the Renaissance ends. This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper.\"\n\n- Ivor Catt, January 1993",
