    "snippet" : "\"Given statements emanating from some cosmologists today one could be forgiven for assuming that the solution to some of the great problems of the subject, even 'the origin of the Universe' lie just around the corner. As an example of this triumphalist approach consider the following conclusion from Hu et al. [1] to a preview of the results they expect from spacecraft such as MAP and PLANCK designed to map the Cosmic Background Radiations: '... we will establish the cosmological model as securely as the Standard Model of elementary particles. We will then know as much, or even more, about the early Universe and its contents as we do about the fundamental constituents of matter'.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
