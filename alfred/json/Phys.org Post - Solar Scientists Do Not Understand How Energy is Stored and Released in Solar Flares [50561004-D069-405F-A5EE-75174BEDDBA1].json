They can sear the earth with deadly ultraviolet light, X-rays, and solar cosmic rays.  A medium-sized flare can release the energy equivalent of a billion megatons of TNT in a few minutes.  And such a flare can occur once a day somewhere on the sun.  The question is, how does the sun do it?  More solar astronomers work toward understanding how energy is stored and released in flares than on any other topic and yet only lately have they gained any real observational support for their ideas.\"\n\n(and on p197 ...)\n\n\"Predicting flares, even a day in advance, has remained an art rather than an objective science.\"",
