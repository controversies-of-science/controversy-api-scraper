The observations (their Fig. 24) show magnetic field lines changing direction as they cross the filament, first into then out of the plane of the sky. Since these are one-dimensional (1D) projections of an intrinsically 3D field structure, they cannot be uniquely interpreted by themselves. However, given that circular (or more generally, helical) fields, which would be generated primarily by currents moving along the filaments, are the form that is necessary to confine filaments of approximately uniform thickness, the Heiles (1997) observations constituted a 'smoking gun' ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
