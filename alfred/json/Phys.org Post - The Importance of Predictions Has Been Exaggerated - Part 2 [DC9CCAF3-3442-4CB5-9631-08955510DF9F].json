It is found that the success or failure of these predictions had essentially no effect on the acceptance of Alfvén's theories, even though concepts such as ‘Alfvén waves' have become firmly entrenched in space physics. Perhaps the importance of predictions in such has been exaggerated: if a theory is not acceptable to the scientific community, it may not gain any credit from successful predictions.\"",
