    "snippet" : "Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., The Geometrisation of Physics, and its supposed Basis on the Michelson-Morley Experiment. Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.796\n\n\"The prominent merit of these [Relativity] equations is that they replace any apparent predilection for forces acting at a distance, by explicit recognition of a modified medium (or at least a modified space) in contact with the accelerated particle. The beauty and ingenuity of this scheme, and of the reasoning associated with it, are apt to overpower the judgment at times, and to lead to pseudo-philosophic conclusions which are not really justified, and some of which are repugnant to common-sense. It is scarcely wise to seek to interpret physically every link in a chain of mathematical reasoning.\"",
