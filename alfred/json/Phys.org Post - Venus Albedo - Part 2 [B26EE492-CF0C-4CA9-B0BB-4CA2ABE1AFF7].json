    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"It turns out that only by adopting the most myopic view possible can you get thermal equilibrium from the evidence, and that is what Tomasko does.\n\nFor thermal equilibrium to pertain, two numbers must match up; the first is emissions which all parties involved agree reads correctly as 0.76. The second number is the planetary albedo. Tomasko claims (pp 611-612) 'For the whole planet to be in equilibrium with absorbed sunlight, the bolometric albedo would have to be 0.76 ...' But the Pioneer Venus readings on albedo (Taylor's article, page 658) was 0.80 plus\/minus 0.02, and the calculations from Venera data (also page 658) are 0.79, plus 0.02, minus 0.01. The closest you could get and stay within error bounds is 0.78.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
