    "snippet" : "\"If all mice have tails and this is a mouse, then it has a tail.  The theorem behind this line of reasoning is known as 'modus ponens'.  An encounter with three blind, tailless mice doesn't disprove the theorem; only the premise that all mice have tails.  Credulists are not always as logical.  To say 'if receding stars have redshifts and this star has a redshift then it is receding' is not modus ponens, it is 'pons asinorum'.  It is no more logical than to assert that everything with a tail must be a mouse.\"\n\n- Prof. John Billingsley",
