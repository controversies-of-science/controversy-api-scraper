Behe, Darwin's Black Box, The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, p.6\n\n\"When things are going smoothly in our lives most of us tend to think that the society we live in is 'natural,' and that our ideas about the world are self-evidently true. It's hard to imagine how other people in other times and places lived as they did or why they believed the things they did.
