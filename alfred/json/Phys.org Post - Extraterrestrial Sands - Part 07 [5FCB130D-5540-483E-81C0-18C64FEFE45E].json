    "snippet" : "p167:\n\n\"Every object has a net charge. That net charge can be positive, negative or zero. Quartz grains are considered as having a negative surface charge whereas clay minerals in most soils are positively charged. Iron oxides are also generally negatively charged, although the charge can vary.\n\nPrecipitating out of a moisture-laden, dust-filled atmosphere, immense clouds of sand fall to Earth -- their size largely dictated by the density of the silica-based rock vapor. As the angular grains fall their surfaces take on a negative charge. Submicroscopic clay particles and iron oxides in the atmosphere become positively charged. Like a magnet, the negatively charged quartz grains attract the positively charged clay and iron oxide nanoparticles, coating the grains all over. This fundamental process (and the many possible variants) lies at the heart of how sand gained its coatings, indeed its color ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
