Within certain limits, it can suffice. But when gradual quantitative change suddenly breaks down, and becomes 'chaotic,' to use the current expression, the linear equations of classical mathematics no longer suffice. This is the starting point for the new non-linear mathematics, pioneered by Benoit Mandelbrot, Edward Lorenz and Mitchell Feigenbaum.\"",
