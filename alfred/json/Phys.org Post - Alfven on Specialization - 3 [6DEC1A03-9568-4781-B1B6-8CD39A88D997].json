When running a lab, I found that one of my most important activities was to go from room to room and discuss in depth the problems that a certain scientist or a group of scientists was trying to understand. It often happened that one group reported that in their field they had a special problem which they could not possibly understand. I told them that if they cared to open the door to the next room -- it was not locked! -- just this special problem had been solved half a year ago, and if they injected the solution into their own field, it would take a great leap forward. Often they were not at all happy for this suggestion ...\"\n\n\"... Dr. Roederer's prescription for curing this serious disease is 'tearing down disciplinary barriers,' indeed 'interdisciplinarification' of science. This seems to be wise. However, we must suspect that to many astrophysicists this is bitter medicine. Can we find ways to sweeten it?\n\n(cont'd)",
