    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Of course, science already accepts such a code of procedure in principle, but there is a wide gap between that which scientists subscribe to as a matter of principle and that which they do in actual practice. In principle valid criticism of accepted ideas should be hospitably received as a worth-while contribution to scientific knowledge; in practice such criticism is strongly resented by the 'experts' in the particular field involved, and in line with the old adage that 'it is the truth that hurts,' the more pertinent the criticism the stronger the resentment. In principle a new idea of merit should be welcomed with open arms; in practice even a relatively modest proposal for modification of existing viewpoints is looked upon with distaste and suspicion, while a major new development has to fight every inch of the way.\"\n\n- Dewey B.
