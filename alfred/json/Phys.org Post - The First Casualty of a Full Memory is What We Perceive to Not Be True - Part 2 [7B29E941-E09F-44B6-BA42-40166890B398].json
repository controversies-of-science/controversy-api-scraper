These shortcuts, he says, are our everyday mode of thinking. Unfortunately, he adds, they can also lead us into making foolish mistakes.\n\nInstead of pursuing a set of rules and following through every piece of information to its logical conclusion, Johnson-Laird believes we construct 'mental models' -- imaginary sketches of the possibilities of a situation -- and work from these ... When we draw our mental models of a situation our working memory runs out of space very quickly. So, to save time, space and effort, we leave vital information off the 'drawings'. The pictures are all there, but the labels -- like 'this picture is only true if the other picture is false' -- can go missing. The first casualty of a full memory is anything that's not true, says Johnson-Laird.\"",
