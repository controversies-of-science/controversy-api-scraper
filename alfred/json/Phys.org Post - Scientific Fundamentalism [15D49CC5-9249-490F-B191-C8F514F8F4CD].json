    "snippet" : "\"The secularist is on solid ground only when he says that science works -- at least in achieving the aims to which it reasonably limits itself -- and that it accumulates. The fatal extrapolation to make from this position is that it must, therefore, potentially be omnicompetent and omniscient. Scientific fundamentalism is the belief that the world is accessible to and ultimately controllable by human reason. This is a profoundly unscientific idea. It is neither provable nor refutable ... Yet the belief in the possibility of human omniscience has been as strong in recent years as it was in the 1930s, when scientistic fantasists dreamed of a world run by a collection of hard-headed scientist-oligarchs.\"\n\n- Brian Appleyard",
