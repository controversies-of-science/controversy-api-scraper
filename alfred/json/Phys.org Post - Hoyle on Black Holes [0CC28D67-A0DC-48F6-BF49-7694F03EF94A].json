    "snippet" : "Hoyle, Burbidge & Narlikar, A Different Approach to Cosmology, p.316\n\n\"... in more than two decades no convincing explanation for the presence of black holes at the centers of galaxies has been given ... When a cloud condenses, the inward gravitational forces increase as the inverse square of the scale of the cloud. But the rotary forces inhibiting condensation increase as the cube. Since the two are not far from being in balance initially, not much condensation is permitted before rotation becomes inimical to any further rise of the internal density ... The center of a galaxy is certainly a unique point geometrically. But rotary forces are not suspended there. The situation is just the same there as for the disks of spirals.\"",
