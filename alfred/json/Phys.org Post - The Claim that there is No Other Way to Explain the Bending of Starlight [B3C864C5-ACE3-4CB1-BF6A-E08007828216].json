    "snippet" : "\"One of the most sensational predictions from Einstein's general theory of relativity was the gravitational deflection of starlight. This has no counterpart in classical physics. Since the masses of both interacting objects enter into Newton's expresson for gravitational attraction, a massless entity (such as light) cannot respond to the force of gravity. In contrast, Einstein showed that gravity can be viewed, not as a force between objects, but as a change in the geometry of the playing field -- spacetime itself -- in which objects exist. Motion, in this view, always takes place in the straightest available path, which may be curved if the straightest path is not exactly what we would think of as 'straight.' Light, too, might have to transit in such a path.\"\n\n- Professor William C. (Bill) Keel of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama",
