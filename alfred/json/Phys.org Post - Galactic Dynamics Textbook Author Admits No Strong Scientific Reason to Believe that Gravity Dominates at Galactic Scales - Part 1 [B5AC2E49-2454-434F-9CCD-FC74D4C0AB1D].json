    "snippet" : "Bankrupting Physics: How Today's Top Scientists Are Gambling Away Their Credibility\nAlexander Unzicker and Sheilla Jones (p10, 2013)\n\n\"Combing through the library, I found a well-known textbook on galactic dynamics where the authors state:\n\n'It is worth remembering that all of the discussion so far has been based on the premise that Newtonian gravity and general relativity are correct on large scales. In fact, there is little or no direct evidence that conventional theories of gravity are correct on scales much larger than a light year or so. Newtonian gravity works extremely well on scales of 10^12 meters, the solar system (...) It is principally the elegance of general relativity and its success in solar system tests that lead us to the bold extrapolation to scales 10^19 - 10^24 meters ... [3]'\"\n\n(cont'd)",
