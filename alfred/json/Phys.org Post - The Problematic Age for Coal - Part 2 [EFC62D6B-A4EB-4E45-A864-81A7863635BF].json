There are many other unpublished accounts by C14 laboratories in which the use of coal as a background test material has been investigated. In many cases, the samples were found to contain C14, and further studies were discontinued. The AMS and gas counting facilities, DSIR, in Lower Hutt, New Zealand, eg, have observed apparent ages for coal specimens ranging from 25-40 kyr, and the NSF Accelerator Facility at Tucson, Arizona has determined ages of anthracite samples ranging from 30-40 kyr (AJT Jull, pers commun, 1988) ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
