Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.796\n\n\"The Relativity argument is based on a policy of exclusion. It rejects everything that seems unnecessary; it dispenses with many of our long-standing conceptions; and accordingly is hailed as a simplification. The first simplification was the denial of any test for motion through a continuous fundamental medium, and a consequent ignoring of such a medium. The second step was to eliminate gravitational and other forces, with further denial of a power of discrimination between different kinds of acceleration.
