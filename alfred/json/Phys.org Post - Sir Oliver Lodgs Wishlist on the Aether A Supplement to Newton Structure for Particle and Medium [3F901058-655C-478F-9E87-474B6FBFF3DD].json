Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.799\n\n\"... what is really wanted for a truly Natural Philosophy is a supplement to Newtonian mechanics, expressed in terms of the medium which he suspected and sought after but could not attain, and introducing the additional facts, chiefly electrical -- especially the fact of variable inertia -- discovered since his time ...\n\nIf we could understand the structure of the particle, in terms of the medium of which it is composed, and if we knew the structure of the rest of the medium also, so as to account for the potential stress at every point -- that would be a splendid step, beyond anything accomplished yet.\"",
