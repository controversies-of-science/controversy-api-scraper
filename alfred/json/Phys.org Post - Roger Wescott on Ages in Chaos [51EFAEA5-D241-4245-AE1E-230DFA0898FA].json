    "snippet" : "Roger W. Wescott, Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics, Drew University, Madison, New Jersey U.S.A. SIS Review, Vol VI No. 4, 1984\n\n\"I have now read Ages in Chaos in full and can say that it is the finest publication I have yet seen from the S.I.S. My brief reactions are these. First, I like John Bimson's phrase 'revised stratigraphy' and agree that a revised historical chronology depends on it. Second, I concur with Peter James that the Chaldaean\/Hittite equation is one of the weakest of the Velikovskian theses. (Luckily, however, it is not at all crucial to the Revised Chronology as a whole.) And finally I follow Bass and Juergens in seeing celestial dynamics as focal for catastrophist theory. In particular, we need better evidence, both theoretical and empirical, for solar energy sources and for planetary orbital stability -- or instability.\"",
