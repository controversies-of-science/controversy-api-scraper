Consider what Taylor claims would have to be believed if the 0.80 figure for albedo were to hold good (also page 658): 'Clearly, the Pioneer measurements of emission and reflection are not consistent with each other if radiative balance applies.\n\nTaylor does not particularly want to believe what the data is telling him: that there is no way that Venus is within error bounds of thermal equilibrium, but he does not deny the data. How then does Tomasko make a claim of equilibrium? Tomasko cites one 1968 calculation of albedo of 0.77 +- 0.07 without bothering to tell you that that estimate was later revised upwards to 0.80 +- 0.07 in 1975 (Taylor tells us that on page 657) ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
