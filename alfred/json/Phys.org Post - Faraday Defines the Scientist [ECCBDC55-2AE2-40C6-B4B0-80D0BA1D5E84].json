    "snippet" : "\"The scientist should be a man willing to listen to every suggestion but determined to judge for himself. He should not be biased by appearances, have no favorite hypothesis, be of no school, in doctrine have no master. He should not be a respecter of persons but of things. Truth should be his primary object. If these qualities be added to industry, he may indeed hope to walk within the veil of the temple of Nature.\"\n\n- Michael Faraday (1791-1867)",
