Kronos, Vol. IV, No. 4 Summer 1979\n\n\"If the Sun and the stars indeed succeed in fusing lighter elements to form heavier ones, are the relevant activities carried out more or less in plain sight -- in their atmospheres?\" [1]\n \nFlagstaff, Arizona\nSpring 1976\n\n[1] Some years ago, R. Shapiro and F. Ward reported (J. Atmos. Sci. 19, 506-508, 1962) that, on the basis of their power spectral analyses, relative sunspot numbers vary with a period of 25.7 months. Providing the above citation, Kunitomo Sakurai of Kanagawa University in Yokohama has recently suggested (Nature 278, 146, 8 March 1979) a correlation between solar neutrino production and the activity responsible for sunspots. The flux of neutrinos, while inexplicably low, seems to vary with a similar period (he arrives at 25.3 months).",
