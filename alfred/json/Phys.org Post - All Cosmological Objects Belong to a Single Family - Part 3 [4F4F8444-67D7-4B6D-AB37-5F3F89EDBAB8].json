The simulation showed how a double radio galaxy 250,000 light-years wide can evolve, in a billion years, through recognizable stages into a barred-spiral galaxy 100,000 light-years wide. Galactic astronomers believe that barred spirals breed new stars and further evolve into the spirals and ellipticals that complete the catalogue of galaxies. In other word radio galaxies seem to be the precursors of all other galaxies. Even double radio galaxies that vary widely in appearance may be merely at different stages on similar evolutionary paths, separated in age by a few million years. In fact, nearly all cosmological objects in the near and far universe, from quasars to spiral galaxies, appear to belong to a single family, differing only in age.\"",
