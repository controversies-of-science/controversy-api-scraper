    "snippet" : "\"Here is a quote from Galileo: 'The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics ... without which it is impossible to understand a single word; without which there is only a vain wandering through a dark labyrinth'. I think Prof Galilei was not quite accurate in his assessment of true mathematics. I would paraphrase it, 'The book of mathematics is written in the language of nature, without which understanding is merely unrooted imagination, vain wandering through a dark labyrinth in the human psyche'. Mathematics does not exist in nature.\"\n\n- Hilton Ratcliffe, Declaration of Intent: Swimming with the salmon, dining with the bears, December 2008",
