Ransom, Sex and Violence in the Solar System, p.63\n\n\"The history of science often is in the situation of having an elegantly formed mathematical theory that does not fit the observed data. The data not fitting the theory could be because (1) there is not enough data, (2) the data are not good, or (3) the theory has flaws, such as bad assumptions or bad reasoning. None of this deters the supporters of the theory.\"",
