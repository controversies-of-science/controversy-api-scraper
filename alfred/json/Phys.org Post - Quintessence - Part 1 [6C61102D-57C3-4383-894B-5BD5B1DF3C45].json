    "snippet" : "\"If lambda represents the energy latent in space, which we realize has intricate structure on subatomic scales, the best theoretical guess is that it should induce a cosmic repulsion 120 powers of 10 stronger than is actually claimed. There is a widely popular idea called 'inflation' ... which postulates that, very early in cosmic history, there was indeed a repulsion as fierce as this. If so, how could it have switched off (or somehow be neutralized) with such amazing precision?\n\nMost physicists suspected that some process, not yet understood, made the resultant vacuum energy exactly zero, just as other features of our universe -- for instance, its net electric charge -- are believed to be. Recent research shows that it is not zero, but it is still very, very, small. Why? ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
