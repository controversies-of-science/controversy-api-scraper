Had the teams been measuring star beams just clipping the Sun’s edge, their displacement might have been large enough to eliminate atmospheric turbulence as the sole cause. In 1919, however, with the star beams closest to the Sun obliterated by the corona, those that could be observed were some way from the Sun’s rim. Consequently the displacements were so small that the entire effect could quite easily have been caused by atmospheric turbulence alone. At some level, the teams were aware of this. Thus, in discussions after the announcement of the eclipse results, Eddington and his assistants admitted that calculations of small displacements were unreliable. Yet, they refused to let this effect their presentation of the measurements. As we have seen, within a few months Einstein’s ideas were being adjudged victorious from the pulpit of the Astronomer Royal.\"",
