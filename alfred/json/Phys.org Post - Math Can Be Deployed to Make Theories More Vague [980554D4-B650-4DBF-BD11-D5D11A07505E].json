    "snippet" : "Whittaker, Sir Edmund, From Euclid to Eddington, Dover Publications, New York, 1958, p.162 (In Dewey B. Larson, New Light on Space & Time)\n\n\"One of the major virtues of mathematical treatment in general is the precision with which mathematical statements can be made, but in present-day physics mathematical methods are deliberately employed for the opposite purpose: to make theories more 'abstract'; that is, more vague. As Whittaker comments, 'the mathematical physicist ... is interested in non-commutative symbolism for a wholly different reason. He may be said to be, in a certain sense, moving away from precision.'\"",
