    "snippet" : "\"Recently, theoretical physicist Paul Davies was awarded Â£650,000 by the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, for showing 'extraordinary originality' in advancing humankind's understanding of God or spirituality. Previous winners include Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Mother Teresa, evangelist Billy Graham, and the Watergate burglar-turned-preacher Charles Colson. Davies, author of such books as God and the New Physics, The Mind of God and The Last Three Minutes, insists that he is 'not a religious person in the conventional sense' (whatever that might mean), but he maintains that 'science offers a surer path to God than religion.' Despite Davies' ifs and buts, it is clear that he represents a definite trend, which is attempting to inject mysticism and religion into science.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
