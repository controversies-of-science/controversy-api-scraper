Once during a discussion about the forces that bind atom to atom he picked up a stick that lay on the lecture table, and he seemed merely to be toying with it, when suddenly he said, 'The whole problem of physics lies in this: why, when I pick up one end of the stick, does not the other end come up too? The forces that hold the stick in one are those also which bind the universe together'\n\n'I think of him,' said Sir William Bragg, 'as a really magnificent figure, tall and impressive, a marvelous teacher, an enterprising thinker and a great worker, who had a remarkable influence on his contemporaries and students. He was a very distinguished man of science.'\"",
