    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"For the case of a fully ionized hydrogenic plasma, the ions drift inwards until they reach a radius where the temperature is well below the ionization potential and the rate of recombination of the hydrogen plasma is considerable. Because of this 'ion pump' action, hydrogenic plasma will be evacuated from the surroundings and neutral hydrogen will be most heavily deposited in regions of strong magnetic field.\"",
