    "snippet" : "\"Scientific discovery is often carelessly looked upon as the creation of some new knowledge which can be added to the great body of old knowledge. This is true of the strictly trivial discoveries. It is not true of the fundamental discoveries ... on which scientific advance ultimately depends. These always entail the destruction of or disintegration of old knowledge before the new can be created.\"\n\n- C. D.
