    "snippet" : "Sydney Chapman, The Solar Wind, Mackin & Neugebauer Eds., 1964, p.xxiii-xxiv\n\n\"The nature of solar flares is still a great mystery. Parker, after careful investigation (1963), ruled out the mutual annihilation of magnetic fields as the source of the energy manifested in flares. ... It seems appropriate to call attention to the ideas, put forward over many years by Bruce, concerning the importance of electrical discharges in the cosmos, and in particular in the Sun's atmosphere. Bruce agrees that the Sun offers his ideas perhaps their greatest challenge, because of the very high electrical conductivity of the solar material at all levels. Any electrical discharge in the Sun's atmosphere demands an exceptionally rapid and strong means of generating differences in electric potential ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
