If observations are made that, after careful verification and theoretical analysis, are found to be inconsistent with a theory, then that theory has to go -- no matter how aesthetically pleasing it is, or how prestigious its supporters are, or how many billions of dollars a certain industry has bet on it.\n\nBut in current mainstream science, the opposite occurs with disturbing regularity.
