    "snippet" : "\"Physicists have believed for more than 100 years that the speed of light was the same for all nonaccelerating observers. This is one of the postulates that Einstein proposed in 1905, with the first experimental evidence supposed to have been based upon the results of the Michelson-Morley 1887 experiment. However a re-analysis in 2002 of the fringe-shift data from that experiment showed that the data indicated a speed in excess of 300 km\/s. So far another six experiments have been found that also revealed a similar speed. It means that space has a substructure, that absolute motion is observable, that the spacetime construct has no ontological meaning, despite its use in quantum field theory\"\n\n- The Speed of Light and the Einstein Legacy: 1905-2005, Reginald T.
