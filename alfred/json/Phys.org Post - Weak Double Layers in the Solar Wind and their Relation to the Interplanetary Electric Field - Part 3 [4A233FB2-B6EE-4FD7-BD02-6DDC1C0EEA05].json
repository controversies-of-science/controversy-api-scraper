This gives the first observational indication of the existence of the large-scale electric field in the interplanetary medium, which plays a fundamental role in the expansion of the solar wind [20]. Furthermore, a correlation is found between the energy of the coherent ion acoustic waves and the amplitude of the interplanetary electric field expected in a two-fluid model, with a spiral magnetic field. These results suggest that the observation of weak double layers in the solar wind is related to the existence of the interplanetary electric field. The corresponding electric potential difference between the solar corona and the Earth orbit would actually be established through a succession of small potential drops across a multitude of WDL, distributed intermittently along the radial direction.\"",
