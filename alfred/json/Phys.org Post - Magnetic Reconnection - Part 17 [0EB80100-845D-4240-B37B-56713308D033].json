    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"The magnetic field in a compass needle not only extends beyond the compass needle, but it goes through the compass needle.  But it's not anchored to anything.  It's there because the properties of the compass needle.\n\nThe magnetic fields themselves - not the lines - are created by the interweave of electric currents.  But, the lines have no beginning or end, of course; they form from continuous loops so there's no end of it that's anchored to a point on the Sun or any other body.\n\nAnother quote:\n\n'The field lines are sometimes traveling in the same direction, and don't have much effect on each other, like two water currents flowing along side each other.' (NASA press release)\n\nWell, of course, the field lines don't travel.  They're only conceptual paths.  They're loci or paths drawn by a draftsman that describe the instantaneous direction of the elements in the magnetic vector field at any given moment.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
