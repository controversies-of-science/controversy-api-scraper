    "snippet" : "Ralph E. Juergens, The Photosphere: Is It the Top or the Bottom of the Phenomenon We Call the Sun? Kronos, Vol. IV No. 4, Summer 1979\n\n\"On any appraisal, then, a [photospheric] granule may be viewed as a relatively dense, highly luminous, secondary plasma that springs into being in the embrace of a thinner, less luminous, primary plasma. Where on earth might such a phenomenon be observed? The electric-sun hypothesis assigns the solar body the role of anode -- that of the higher-potential electrode -- in a cosmical electric discharge. Considering this, and recognizing granules as cells of secondary plasma, we are led directly to ask whether the granules might not be akin to certain highly luminous tufts of discharge plasma variously described in the literature as anode glows, anode tufts, and anode arcs.\"",
