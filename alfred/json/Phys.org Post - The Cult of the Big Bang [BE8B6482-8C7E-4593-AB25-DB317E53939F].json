Stretching on the rack and burning at the stake of pagans and heretics are frowned on.  Those who reject the faith are merely ostracized.  They and any who seriously question the dogma are excommunicated; banished from recognition in the halls of higher learning, and denied the opportunity for Cosmological Brotherhood.\n\nIt's not for common parishioners or parish priests to question the Doctrine of the Cult.
