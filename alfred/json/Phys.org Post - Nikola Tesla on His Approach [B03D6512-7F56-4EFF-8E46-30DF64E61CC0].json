    "snippet" : "\"In presenting these insignificant results I have not attempted to arrange and coordinate them, as would be proper in a strictly scientific investigation, in which every succeeding result should be a logical sequence of the preceding, so that it might be guessed in advance by the careful reader or attentive listener.  I have preferred to concentrate my energies chiefly upon advancing novel facts or ideas which might serve as suggestions to others, and this may serve as an excuse for the lack of harmony.  The explanations of the phenomena have been given in good faith and in the spirit of a student prepared to find that they admit of a better interpretation.  There can be no great harm in a student taking an erroneous view, but when great minds err, the world must dearly pay for their mistakes.\"\n\n- Nikola Tesla, On Light And Other High Frequency Phenomena",
