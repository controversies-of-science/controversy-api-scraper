An observation which we believe is highly significant is that for many spiral galaxies the measured interstellar magnetic fields falls off much more slowly with radius than the matter density, i.e. in the outer parts of such galaxies the magnetic stresses become comparable to gravity. Not only is this hard to understand in theoretical modelling, but it is taking place at distances where the rotation curve is flat and the flatness is usually interpreted as evidence for the presence of a halo of dark matter. Thus the neglect of this effect may have a bearing on the conventional dark matter arguments.\"",
