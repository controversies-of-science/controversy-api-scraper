    "snippet" : "Louis Kervran, from the English translation by Michel Abehsera, Epilogue, Biological Transmutations\n\n\"The entire genesis and evolution of our planet needs to be restudied in light of transmutation, which opens new horizons to geologists and philosophers, as well as to metaphysicians. The latter can find grounds for meditation in the fact that the vital phenomenon of life is not chemistry alone.\n\nThis does not mean that the recognition of biological transmutation is another step toward comprehending Life. On the contrary, I would say that it is a step toward demonstrating that Life is more complex than some bio-chemists would like to believe.\"",
