And so, therefore, it was invisible.  So, he could postulate its existence, and we couldn't see it.  And because we couldn't see it, we couldn't prove that it wasn't there. Later on, in order to explain these fantastic emissions of energy from galaxies, it was proposed -- and I believe it was Stephen Hawking who did it -- that there were various types of black holes, some of which actually then spat matter back out again in jets -- because why?  Because we had observed jets.\"",
