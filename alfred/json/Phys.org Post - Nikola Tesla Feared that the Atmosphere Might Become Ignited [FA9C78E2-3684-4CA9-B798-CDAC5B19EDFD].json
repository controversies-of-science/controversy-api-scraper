    "snippet" : "\"Mr. Nikola Tesla, of world-wide fame, announces that if we are not cautious we may set light to the atmosphere with our electric discharges of a 'few million volts.' He suggests that 'periodical cessations of organic life on the globe 'might have been caused through the ignition of the air by flashes of lightning. Electricity is, indeed, a mysterious force, and Mr. Tesla's warning certainly appeals to the imagination. It would be interesting to know if the distinguished American electrician has a remedy to propose.\"\n\n- Herbert C. Fyfe, From Pearson's Magazine, July 1900",
