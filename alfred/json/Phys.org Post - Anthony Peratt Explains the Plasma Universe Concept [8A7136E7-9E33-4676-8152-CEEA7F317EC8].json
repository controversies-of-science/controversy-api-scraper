    "snippet" : "Anthony Peratt, Not With A Bang, The Sciences Jan\/Feb 1990\n\n\"... not only is the universe permeated by plasmas and plasma currents, but its dynamics are dominated by electromagnetic, not gravitational, forces ... Like predawn mist beading on a spider's web, the observable cosmos condenses out of the plasma background in progressively smaller steps, eventually forming stars, planets and moons. There is no expansion, and there need not be any final crunch. Unlike the universe envisioned in the big bang model, the plasma universe evolves without beginning and without end: it is indefinitely ancient and has an indefinite lifetime in store.\"",
