They had reported that the 1.7-second light deflection was ‘non-existent’. Ten further eclipse observations were made between 1922 and 1952. Only one of these produced seemingly high-quality data, and that suggested a displacement arc of 2.24 seconds — substantially higher than predicted by Einstein. In fact, virtually every eclipse observation was either unreliable or, in most cases, both unreliable and higher than the Eddington scores. In light of these results, many of those at the cutting-edge of research into general relativity sensibly deferred judgement for rather longer than the accepted view implies. Some embraced general relativity only when evidence of an entirely different type became available ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
