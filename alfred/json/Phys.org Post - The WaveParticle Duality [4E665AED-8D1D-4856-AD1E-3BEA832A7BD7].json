    "snippet" : "\"... the point that I raised at the Michelson-Morley centenary seminar, asking about the apparent paradox in their experiment that although Michelson-Morley pre-date wave\/particle dualism, both wave and particle have to be assumed at different stages in the experiment to suppress anomalies. It appears to me that for the experiment to have any value, the light must act as particles during its travel, because parallel waves would interfere with each other and ruin the experiment; but it has to act as waves on arrival in order to determine transit time difference by interference fringes. In the Michelson-Morley centenary seminar, speaker Professor Kilmister said, 'That has never been mentioned before'. It has never been mentioned since -- being suppressed for good reason.\"\n\n- Ivor Catt",
