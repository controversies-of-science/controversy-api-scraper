The complexities of the issue receded from view, and the controversy between Einstein and the Newtonians suddenly—but falsely—appeared to be a one-horse race. This is clear from the account of the eclipse expeditions in James A. Coleman’s best-selling Relativity for the Layman (1969):\n\nThe Sobral group found that their stars had moved an average of 1.98 seconds of arc, and the Principe group’s had moved 1.6 seconds of arc. This nearness to the 1.74 seconds of arc predicted by Einstein was sufficient to verify the effect.\n\nBut in many cases unwittingly, Coleman and dozens of other scientific commentators skate over the fact that among astronomers Eddington’s account did not win immediate assent ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
