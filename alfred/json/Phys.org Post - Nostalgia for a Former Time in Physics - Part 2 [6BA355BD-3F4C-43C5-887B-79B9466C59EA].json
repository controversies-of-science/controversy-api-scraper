It would be a bonus if some of the discussed ideas in the workshop were shown to be correct. This would mean that it is still possible to do first rank physics, rather than the usual second or third class science. Unfortunately, whether these ideas are correct or not, the scientific community is probably not yet ready to change its mind and abandon its dogma of Doppler\/expansion redshifts, so we cannot know at present how much truth they contain. We will have to wait for the future, for Nature's answer. We should also bear in mind that Nature does not care about our illusions; the truth is independent of our nostalgias.\"\n\n- Mart́ın Lopez-Corredoira, Instituto de Astrofısica de Canarias",
