    "snippet" : "\"It must be said that positing an unreal object to account for physical phenomena is tantamount to a belief in ghosts. If a theorist is unable to discover real objects which cause observed effects, it is unscientific -- indeed, it is fraudulent science -- to invent an unreal, ghost-like 'object' and present it as a valid discovery of the cause of those effects ... And yet, according to many of today's more influential philosophers of science, it is unscientific to claim reality for anything other than experimental measurements, or 'dial readings'. Other physical quantities or objects identify only dial readings and\/or their relationships, according to this view. To claim reality for any entities, whether wave functions or pumpkins, is held to be 'unempirical'. Modern empiricism turns traditional empiricism exactly on its head.\"\n\n- Lewis E.
