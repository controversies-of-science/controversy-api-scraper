    "snippet" : "Braithwaite, R. B., Scientific Explanation, Cambridge University Press, 1953, p.51 (In Dewey B. Larson, New Light on Space & Time)\n\n\"The typical present-day contribution to physical theory consists of a rigorous mathematical 'calculus' which is, in the words of Rudolf Carnap, 'constructed floating in the air, so to speak,' and which deals with terms whose meaning, if any, is vague and indefinite. 'The words may have independent meaning,' says Braithwaite, 'but this is not how the words are used in a treatise on physics. There they are used as symbols in a calculus which is to be interpreted as an applied deductive system; they are not understood as having any meaning apart from their place in such a calculus.'\"",
