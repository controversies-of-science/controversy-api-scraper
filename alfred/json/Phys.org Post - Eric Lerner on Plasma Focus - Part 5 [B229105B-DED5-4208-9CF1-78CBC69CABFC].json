    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... This survivor pinches itself off into a doughnut-shaped filamentary knot -- a plasmoid (Fig. 6.13b).\n\nThe plasmoid, only a half-millimeter across, now contains all the energy stored in the magnetic field of the entire device -- a million or more times bigger in volume. For a fraction of a micro-second, as the plasmoid continues to pinch itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because plasma tends to be opaque to low-frequency radiation and transparent to high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape.\n\nThis sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens. Since the electrons are traveling along magnetic-field lines, the weakening field tangles the electrons' path up as its shape changes -- causing the current to drop still further ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
