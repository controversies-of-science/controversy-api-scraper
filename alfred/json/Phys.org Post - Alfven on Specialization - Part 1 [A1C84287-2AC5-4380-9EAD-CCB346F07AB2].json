    "snippet" : "\"Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics\" (1986)\n\n\"The Roederer Syndrome\n\nIn his article 'Tearing Down Disciplinary Barriers' [58], Roederer points out the conflict between the demand for 'increased specialization on one hand and the pursuit of an increasingly interdisciplinary approach on the other.'\n\nThis is important. Indeed, in the present state of science, specialization is favored to such an extent that science is split up into a number of increasingly small specialties. We lack the global view ...\n\nWe should remember that there once was a discipline called 'Natural Philosophy' ('reine Naturwissenschaft'). Unfortunately this discipline seems not to exist today. It has been renamed 'science' but science of today is in danger of loosing much of the Natural Philosophy aspect ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
