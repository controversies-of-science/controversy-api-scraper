    "snippet" : "Alfvén's Programme in Solar System Physics by Stephen G. Brush, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Vol. 20, No. 6, Dec 1992\n\n\"According to some scientists and philosophers of science, a theory is or should be judged by its ability to make successful predictions. This paper examines a case from the history of recent science -- the research of Hannes Alfvén and his colleagues on solar system physics -- in order to see whether scientists actually follow this policy. Tests of seven predictions are considered: magnetic braking magnetohydrodynamic waves, field-aligned ('Birkeland') currents, critical ionization velocity and the rings of Uranus, jet streams, electrostatic double layers, and partial corotation ('2\/3 effect') ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
