    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"During my stay in Princeton, Velikovsky attended the weekly astronomy seminars, whether to learn something of astronomy itself or to learn what made astronomers tick, I never really discovered. Perhaps because I couldn't see what the fuss was about, and so was calm about it, Velikovsky used to come to talk at the tea intervals that preceded the seminars. I managed to convey to him that our ground rules were different from his. He believed in the primacy of documentary evidence, whereas we believed in the primacy of mathematical rules, rules that enabled us to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, where and when the next total eclipse of the Sun was going to occur. This made Velikovsky look sad, which is how we parted.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
