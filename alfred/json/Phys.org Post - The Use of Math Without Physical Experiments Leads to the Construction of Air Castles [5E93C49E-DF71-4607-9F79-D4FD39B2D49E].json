    "snippet" : "\"Generally, mathematics should be used to find exact solutions only after we have diligently developed working mental models to explain phenomena. Finding these mental models requires participating in concrete laboratory experiments. The use of math without physical experiments leads to the construction of 'air castles,' which have no firm foundation in reality. Ultimately, you must visualize the principle under consideration before you can use the full powers of your intellect to find an innovative solution.\"\n\n- R.A. Ford, Homemade Lightning",
