    "snippet" : "\"My opinion about [Dayton] Miller's experiments is the following ... Should the positive result be confirmed, then the special theory of relativity and with it the general theory of relativity, in its current form, would be invalid. Experimentum summus judex. Only the equivalence of inertia and gravitation would remain, however, they would have to lead to a significantly different theory.\"\n\n- Albert Einstein, in a letter to Edwin E. Slosson, July 1925",
