Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.796-797\n\n\"The fact is that the lines of force on an isolated charged sphere redistribute themselves, if it be moving through the aether, as if it had become a stationary oblate spheroid with axis in the direction of motion. Such a spheroid becomes the static representation of a moving sphere, and may be held to take its place as the most symmetrical figure; for the only way in which we can infer the virtual shape of an electron is by the distribution of its field.\"",
