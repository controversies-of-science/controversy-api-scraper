    "snippet" : "\"It is very easy for the modeller to produce the predestined outcome before the model can be run. This is a common flaw in mathematical modelling. A model is not real. Models are not evidence. Models with simulations, projections and predictions prove nothing. All a model shows is something about the model itself and the modellers, normally their limitations. As the Talmud states: 'We do not see things as they are. We see them as we are.'\"\n\n- Ian Plimer, Heaven and Earth: Global Warming - The Missing Science",
