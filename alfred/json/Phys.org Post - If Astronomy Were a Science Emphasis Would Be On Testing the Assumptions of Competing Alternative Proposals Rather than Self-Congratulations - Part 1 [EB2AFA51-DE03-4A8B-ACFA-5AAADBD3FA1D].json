    "snippet" : "\"Different assumptions of different proposals would give different interpretations, which then would validate the different proposals. This codependency of observation and theory is one reason that verifying a theory doesn't prove that it's true.\n\nAlso, the validation is fallacious. A logical fallacy originally noted by Aristotle is affirmation of the consequent, which can be illustrated as follows: A implies B. B is true therefore A is true. By claiming that the proposal is true because a consequence of the theory has been observed, astronomers (and other scientists) overlook other possible explanations for the consequent. The logical fallaciousness does not mean that the theory cannot be useful, but it assures that science will always be provisional.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
