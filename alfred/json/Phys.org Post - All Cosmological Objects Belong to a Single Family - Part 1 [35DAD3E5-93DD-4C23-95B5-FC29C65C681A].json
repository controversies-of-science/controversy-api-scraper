Peratt, New Beginnings: Creating the Universe Without the Big Bang, The Sciences, Jan\/Feb 1990, p.29-30\n\n\"One of the brightest synchrotron sources in the sky is Cygnus A, a double radio galaxy thought to be hundreds of millions of light-years away. Through a radio telescope Cygnus A appears as two C-shaped lobes of intense synchrotron radiation, about 250,000 light-years apart and each measuring about 100,000 light-years across (about the diameter of our galaxy). Each lobe, moreover, emits a hot spot of radiation near the end of one arm.\n\nWhy double radio galaxies are structured this way has long been a mystery in astrophysics. The standard explanation is that a black hole emits electron beams, which in turn generate the synchrotron radiation. But that explanation is thrown into doubt by the laboratory demonstrations of synchrotron radiation arising from interactions of plasma filaments ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
