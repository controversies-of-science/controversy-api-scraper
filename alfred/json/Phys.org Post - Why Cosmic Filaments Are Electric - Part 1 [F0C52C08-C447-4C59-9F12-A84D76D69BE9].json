Electrons further from the centre are influenced by this azimuthal component of the magnetic field and move in a more helical path aligned with the main current direction. This helical motion creates the straighter magnetic field lines near the axis ... The nearer the centre of the filament, the straighter are the magnetic field lines and the paths of the electrons ...\"",
