    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Because coal is formed over geological time scales at depths providing excellent shielding from cosmic rays, its C14 content should be insignificant in comparison to the 14C introduced by even the most careful sample preparation techniques used in C14 dating laboratories. How is it then, that a material, which should show a C14 age indistinguishable from that produced by a combination of machine background and contamination during careful sample preparation, routinely produces a finite C14 age?\"\n\nhttp:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download;jsessionid=818AE22B382E0482CAAFDCD33136D9A4?doi=10.1.1.372.4689&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\n\"I would like to suggest a simple explanation for the finite 14C ages observed for many coal specimens, namely microbial and fungal action in coal substrates.\n\nThe action of various kinds of fungi and microbes in coal has been well documented (Paca & Gregr, 1977; Cohen & Aronson, 1987; Greenwell, 1987) ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
