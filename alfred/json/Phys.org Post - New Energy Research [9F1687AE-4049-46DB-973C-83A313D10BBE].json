    "snippet" : "\"American Nobel Laureate in Physics (1988) Leon M. Lederman is no proponent of research into radical forms of new energy; one might accurately call him a 'pathological skeptic' based on at least one opinion he has voiced (see The God Particle, 1993, p.122). Nonetheless, he somehow senses that a physics revolution may be upon us. He said recently, 'You can smell discovery in the air ... The sense of imminent revolution is very strong.' (New York Times, November 11, 2003, p.D12). He is much more accurate than he can imagine, but not at all for reasons that he would readily accept! Perhaps he may be thinking of esoteric academic physics subjects such 'string theory' or 'cosmic dark energy,' but certainly not practical technologies based on radical new physics.\"\n\n- Dr. Eugene F.
