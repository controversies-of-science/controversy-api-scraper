Today, science takes place on such a vast scale that it is not always convenient to replicate every important experiment performed. Further, as the British sociologist Harry Collins and his American collaborator Trevor Pinch have shown, some experiments require specialized training, highly recondite knowledge, and technical expertise that may take months or years for another laboratory to acquire. This means that scientists sometimes just have to take their colleaguesâ€™ word for it ...\n\nIn the case of the Sobral and Principe expeditions, quite apart from the tremendous difficulty in understanding general relativity and performing the appropriate calculations, the experiments themselves were exceptionally difficult to perform, extremely expensive, and totally reliant on eclipses of the Sun ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
