Once the choice is made, however, scientists tend to unify behind the accepted alternative to the extent of denying and eventually forgetting that there was any 'real' choice made. Subsequent textbooks gloss over any possible alternatives, depicting science as a straightforward march up the correct path toward truth. Since it is forgotten and denied that such choices existed, the results of these choices are rarely reviewed. Not only is there no provision, or incentive, for such a review, there is positive, and powerful, peer pressure against any such questioning of basic premises. (The inexcusable treatment of the astronomer Halton Arp [1998] is just one example.)\"",
