    "snippet" : "\"Over the generations free thinkers, many of whom are regarded now as the 'greatest scientists', were simply ordinary people prepared to think outside the established box of ideas. In Galileo's case, the church controlled this box of ideas, but today the reigns are firmly in the hands of the scientific community. It's ironic that people associate the term 'genius' with brainy scientist, when it can also be applied to such creative men as Mozart and Bach. Somehow I don't see creative men being welcomed at the doors of scientific institutions like they once were, and this ignorance, and perhaps arrogance, will ultimately hold back humanity's progress just as the dark ages did.\"\n\n- unknown source",
