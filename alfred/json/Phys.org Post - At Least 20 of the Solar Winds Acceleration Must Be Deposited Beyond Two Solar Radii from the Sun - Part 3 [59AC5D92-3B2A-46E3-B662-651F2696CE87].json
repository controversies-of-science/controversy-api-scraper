    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... In 1988, George Withbroe ... gathered all the existing observations of the fast solar wind and calculated a number of wind models that match them.  He found that at least 20% of the energy input to a fast wind stream must be deposited beyond the distance from the sun (around 2 solar radii) at which the wind reaches the local speed of sound, about 200 km\/s.  The remaining 80% must be injected below that distance.\n\nParker realized that Alfven waves, generated somehow in the photosphere, would not dissipate until they had traveled far along the open field lines of a wind stream.  In this sense Alfven waves are ideal for the purpose of extended heating of the stream.  But the observations of spectral line broadening show that, if Alfven waves exist at all in a coronal hole, they contain barely enough energy (i.e., the necessary 20%) to heat the distant parts of a wind stream and not enough energy to heat the inner parts.\"",
