    "snippet" : "Etienne Klein & Marc Lachi√®ze-Rey, The Quest for Unity - The Adventure of Physics\n\n\"Einstein felt that quantum physics could not possibly be complete on the grounds that it fails to describe the reasons for the behaviour of individual systems and does not go beyond predicting the properties of matter from a statistical perspective. He started with three premises:\n\n1.\tThe predictions of quantum theory are correct\n\n2.\tNo effect can travel faster than the speed of light\n\n3.\tIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e. with a probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.\" (p.62)\n\n\"John Bell ... was able to prove rigorously that any theory claiming to describe reality on the basis of (1) and (3) is automatically in conflict with (2).\" (p.63)",
