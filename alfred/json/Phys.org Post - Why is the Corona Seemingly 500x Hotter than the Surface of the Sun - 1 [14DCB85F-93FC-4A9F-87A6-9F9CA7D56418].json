    "snippet" : "Solar Mystery: Why is the Corona Seemingly 500x Hotter than the Surface of the Sun?\n\nJourney from the Center of the Sun\nJack B. Zirker\n(p3)\n\n\"For reasons we still don't know, the corona is five hundred times hotter than the surface of the sun.  Since heat can't run 'uphill,' from cooler to hotter places, something other than heat and light from the surface must raise the temperature of the corona.  A half dozen ideas have been offered over the past twenty years to explain this state of affairs, but observations have shown all of them to be either incorrect or unverifiable.  So the quest for answers goes on.\"",
