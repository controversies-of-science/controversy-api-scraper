    "snippet" : "\"What science has defeated is the great tradition of idealism. This tradition has hundreds of branches, but let's accept the simple dictionary definition: idealism is 'a theory that ultimate reality lies in a realm transcending phenomena.' By nature most people are idealistic. They accept God and have a will to believe. They are open to experiences beyond their five senses, such as love and beauty. They assume that there is an ultimate Truth.  Idealism thus persists in popular culture, but science has felled it on practically every academic front. To be honest, the assault was stunning, and victory was based on the simplest tactic. 'Show me what you can prove, not what you believe.' Using experimental proof as its standard, science sent idealism scurrying in baffled confusion.\"\n\n- Deepak Chopra, The Downside of Skepticism: Gadflies Without a Sting",
