    "snippet" : "\"Bertrand Russell (1935, p.66) in his description of reason, 'in the first place it relies upon persuasion rather than force; in the second place it seeks to persuade by arguments which the man using them believes to be completely valid; and in the third place it uses observation ... as much as possible and intuition as little as possible.' The first of these rules out the use of inquisitorial methods, the second rules out the use of propaganda and the third rules out appeals to the emotions or self-interest of the audience.\"\n\n- John Hewitt, A Habit of Lies",
