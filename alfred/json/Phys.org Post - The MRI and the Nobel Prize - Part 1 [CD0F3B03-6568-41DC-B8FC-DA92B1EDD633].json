The Nobel committee only recognized Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield for that feat -- an omission that Damadian billed as a 'shameful wrong that must be righted.' 'To wake up on Monday morning and see that I had been written out of history is an agony I cannot live with,' he told the Times.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
