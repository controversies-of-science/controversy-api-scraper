This is the immortality of the soul. There are large souls and small souls. The immortal soul of the 'Scienticulists' is a small affair, scarcely visible. Indeed it's existence has been doubted. That of a Shakespeare or Newton is stupendously big. Such men live the best part of their lives after they are dead. Maxwell is one of these men. His soul will live and grow for long to come, and hundreds of years hence will shine as one of the bright stars of the past, whose light takes ages to reach us.\"",
