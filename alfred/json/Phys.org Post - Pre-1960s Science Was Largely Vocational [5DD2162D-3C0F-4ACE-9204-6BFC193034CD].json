    "snippet" : "\"Science, not so very long ago, pre-1960s, was largely vocational. Back when I was young, I didn't want to do anything else other than be a scientist. They're not like that nowadays. They don't give a damn. They go to these massive, mass-produced universities and churn them out. They say: 'Science is a good career. You can get a job for life doing government work.' That's no way to do science.\"\n\n- James Lovelock",
