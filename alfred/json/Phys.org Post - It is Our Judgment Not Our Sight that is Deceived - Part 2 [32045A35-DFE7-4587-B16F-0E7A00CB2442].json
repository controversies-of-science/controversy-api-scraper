    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... In truth the delusion lies in the mind of the mystic, not in the things seen. The alleged untrustworthiness of our senses we flatly deny. We frequently misinterpret the messages they bring, it is true, but that is no fault of the senses. The interpretation of sense impressions is something to be learned; we never learn it fully; we are liable to blunder through all our days, but that gives us no right to call our senses liars. It is our judgment, not the sense of sight, that is occasionally deceived. We not only wrong our honest senses but also lose our grip upon this most substantial world when we let mistaken metaphysics persuade us to doubt the testimony they bear.\"\n\n- Scientific American, July 1875",
