    "snippet" : "The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary for General Knowledge, Volume 7, edited by George Ripley, Charles Anderson Dana\n\n\"Faraday was opposed to the atomic theory, and it is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to comprehend his idea of the subject. In the place of an atom as a particle of matter he substituted a point or centre of force, and connected points of force with lines of force. He says: 'This view of the constitution of matter would seem to involve necessarily the conclusion that matter fills all space, or at least all space to which gravitation extends; for gravitation is a property of matter dependent on a certain force, and it is this force which constitutes the matter. In that view matter is not mutually penetrable; but each atom extends, so to say, throughout the whole of the solar system, yet always retaining its own centre of force.'\"",
