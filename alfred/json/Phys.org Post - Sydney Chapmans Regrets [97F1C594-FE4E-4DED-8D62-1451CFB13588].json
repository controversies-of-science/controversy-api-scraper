One paragraph in the original draft text quoted Chapman on the field aligned current issue.  Akasofu withdrew the remarks from the published version.  It is probably worth giving Chapman (through Akasofu) the final word: 'Chapman mentioned in his letter to me on 13 April 1969, 'the history of studies of geomagnetic disturbances is a tangled skein,' and he continued '-- but I did overlook something (a three-dimensional current system, the author's insertion) to which I was blind and they (Birkeland and Alfven, the author's insertion) saw.  Perhaps people listened too much to me --.'' This sounds to me like Chapman speaking.\"",
