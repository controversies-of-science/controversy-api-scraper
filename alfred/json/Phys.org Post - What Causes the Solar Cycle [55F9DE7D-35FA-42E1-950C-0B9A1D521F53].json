Everyone has head of sunspots, the dark patches that cover the sun's face like acne.  They are places where powerful magnetic fields (a thousand times the earth's field strength) break through the solar surface.  We know the sun is a magnetic star, capable of generating such strong fields somehow in its interior.  But exactly how does it do it?  And why do the spots come and go in a cycle of about eleven years?  These questions are not purely academic, as we shall see, since there is some persuasive evidence that the earth's atmosphere and its climate responds to this cycle.\"",
