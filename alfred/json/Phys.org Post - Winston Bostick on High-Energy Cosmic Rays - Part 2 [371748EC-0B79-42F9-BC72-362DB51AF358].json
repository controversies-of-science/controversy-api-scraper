But this author, undaunted, plunges even further into this cosmical question: He has the audacity to suggest further that the gigantic galactic jets in the active galaxies such as are now being observed by the computer-synthesized data of the radio signals at a number of wavelengths with the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico, from radio galaxies like Cygnus A and Centaurus A (NGC 5128) are being produced by an electromagnetic-ram action similar to that of the plasma focus; and further, that this action is producing not only these spectacular jets, but also the acceleration of the cosmic ray particles at the same time in the same accelerating gap.\"\n\n- Winston Bostick, The Electromagnetic-Ram Action of the Plasma Focus As a Paradigm for the Production of Gigantic Galactic Jets and Cosmic Rays, International Journal of Fusion Energy, Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1985",
