To do so successfully, not merely becoming a crackpot, requires fine judgement, especially on long-term issues that cannot be settled quickly ... To hold popular opinion is cheap, costing nothing in reputation, whereas to accept that there is evidence pointing oppositely, and hence pointing to something very different as an explanation ... is to risk scientific tar and feathers. Yet to not take the risk is to make certain that, if something new is really there, you won't be the one to find it.\"\n",
