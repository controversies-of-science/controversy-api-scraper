The fact, for instance, that Newton became famous for creating inscrutable in vacuo forces meant that these had to be written into physics for students to inculcate as a condition for graduating in the subject. In the same way, the fact that Einstein (in a moment which he himself regretted) came up with the idea of a 'photon' as a quantum particle of light meant that from then on the 'photon' had to be regarded as a 'fact of nature'. This was despite the fact that not only has the flight in vacuo of this alleged 'light-particle' never been detected but also that it is undetectable even in principle.\"\n\n- POAMS: A Revisionist Approach to Some Recalcitrant Problems in Modern Theoretical Physics, Editor Viv Pope, http:\/\/www.poams.org",
