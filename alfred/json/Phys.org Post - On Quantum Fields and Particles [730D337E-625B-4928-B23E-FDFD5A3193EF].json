    "snippet" : "Etienne Klein & Marc Lachi√®ze-Rey, The Quest for Unity - The Adventure of Physics\n\n\"(Quantum fields) may be the fundamental objects of modern physics, but their properties are purely mathematical.\" (p.67)\n\n\"The technical jargon invented to talk about these ultimate entities of matter is ample proof that they have very little to do with those tiny balls that are all too often used to describe particles, out of habit or oversimplification. In truth they cannot be represented by points or any other geometrical form ... That does not stop scientists from routinely reasoning in terms of particles and their interactions, in other words from using the simple language of classical physics. It is only through such sleight of hand that one can describe interactions as transmitted by forces, as we ourselves will do shortly, and that one can try to unify them.\" (p.68)",
