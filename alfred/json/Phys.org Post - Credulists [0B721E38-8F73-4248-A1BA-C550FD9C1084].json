    "snippet" : "\"Credulists need to have a stream of new theories to believe in.  Those same credulists who forecast a coming ice age during the savage winters of the early sixties are now proclaiming that they have proved that we are going to simmer in a carbon dioxide soup. Credulists are hungry for money to prove their theories correct.  They are happy to ignore any amount of data which disproves the theory, unless of course the theory has been proposed by someone else.  A favourite credulist's refrain is 'my theory could be proved if only I could find a ... perhaps a magnetic monopole or a charmed quark.'\"\n\n- Prof. John Billingsley",
