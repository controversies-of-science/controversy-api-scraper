    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Thus pinching of a filament could occur because, for example, of changes in the fields through which the current filament was flowing ...\n\nAnother significant factor emerges from the mathematical analysis. The force-free or field-aligned arrangement is a minimum energy state for the current to flow in. This means that the field-aligned arrangement is inherently stable. Unless disturbed by external factors, currents will tend to remain aligned with the magnetic field.\n\nWe can now see how field-aligned currents can persist over vast distances. Field-aligned currents are therefore a much more likely explanation of the collimated (parallel-flow) 'jets' seen to be extending for hundreds to thousands of light-years than is the Gravity Model explanation based on conventional fluid flows ...\"",
