Looked at from the privileged viewpoint of the present, many scientific breakthroughs seem so obvious that one is left wondering how our ancestors could ever have been so blind as not to have seen the truth much earlier. This, of course, is to underestimate how profoundly knowledge acquired much later has shaped our own perceptions. Putting aside what we now know is tremendously difficult [...] A common result of this is a tendency to accept too readily claims made about our heroesâ€™ foresight and prescience. We tend uncritically to embrace the conventional model of the scientific genius as someone who sees something in nature that everyone else was too immersed in alternative ways of thought to notice.\"",
