They play a prominent role on ordinary human scales.\" (p.71)\n\n\"The force responsible for ... nuclear cohesion, which neither electromagnetism nor gravitation can explain, has been dubbed the strong nuclear force. Its effects manifest themselves in an extra-ordinarily short time, of the order of 10-23 second. That is the time it takes for certain highly unstable particles, sometimes called 'resonances', to decay into lighter components. There is no faster phenomenon known in nature.\" (p.72)",
