    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"But Newton's theory, which is used successfully to navigate the solar system, has gravity operating instantly. Time doesn't appear in his law of gravity. Newton's gravity acts like a rigid rod between celestial bodies, where the tug at one end is felt immediately at the other end. This is actually essential for the clockwork regularity of the planetary system.\"\n\nNote, for clarity: What Wal Thornhill is pointing out is that the claim that the signals coincide entirely relies entirely upon gravity transmitting at the speed of light; the \"simultaneous\" signal claim should NOT be confused for an objective, independent measure of the experiment's success. In this experiment, it is treated as an assumption.",
