    "snippet" : "Immanuel Velikovsky, Worlds in Collision, p.387\n\n\"The accepted celestial mechanics, notwithstanding the many calculations that have been carried out to many decimal places, or verified by celestial motions, stands only if the sun, the source of light, warmth, and other radiation produced by fusion and fission of atoms, is as a whole an electrically neutral body, and also if the planets, in their usual orbits, are neutral bodies ... In the Newtonian celestial mechanics, based on the theory of gravitation, electricity and magnetism play no role.\"",
