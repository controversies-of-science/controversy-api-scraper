This is precisely the point that was made by Wittgenstein about the World being Language -- or logos, as the Greeks called it (witness the fact that most of our departments of scientific knowledge still retain the suffix '-ology' appended to their titles). On the other hand, any perceptions or conceptions assuming the status of absolute truths may serve as no more than stumbling-blocks in the path of true rational progress, since it is only in the context of experience as a matured whole that our ideas of what there is, and how it is, can be properly verified and understood.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
