    "snippet" : "\"There is absolutely conclusive evidence against the supposition that terrestrial magnetic storms are due to magnetic actions of the sun; or to any kind of dynamical action taking place within the sun, or in connection with hurricanes in its atmosphere, or anywhere near the sun ... The supposed connection between magnetic storms and sunspots is unreal, and the seeming agreement between the periods has been mere coincidence.\"\n\n- Lord Kelvin, Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1892",
