    "snippet" : "\"... First, plasmas are not exotic but quite common.  The interplanetary and interstellar medium and the stars are made of ionized gases.  Thus about 99% of matter in the universe is plasma.  Nearest regions dominated by plasmas are the magnetosphere with its radiation belts, the ionosphere, lightning bolts in the atmosphere, and, in a wider sense, the Earth's core; thus even in the system Earth plasmas are not uncommon.  Plasma physics, therefore, contributes to the understanding of our environment.  In turn, the natural plasma laboratories, i.e. the ionosphere, the magnetosphere, and interplanetary space, help to test the concepts of plasma physics on spatial scales and at densities unattainable in a laboratory ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
