    "snippet" : "Louis Kervran, from the English translation by Michel Abehsera, Epilogue, Biological Transmutations\n\n\"I do not oppose Einstein. I only oppose his unconditional followers who did not understand their master and who applied in all fields laws whose capacity Einstein himself had circumscribed.\n\nBut who reads Einstein? Many of the popular books on relativity are written by professors who misunderstand these laws and who continue to apply automatically the false calculations made by previous authors.\"",
