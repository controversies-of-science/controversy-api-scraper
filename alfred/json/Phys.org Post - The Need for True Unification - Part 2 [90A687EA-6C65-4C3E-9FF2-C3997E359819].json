Exercises in 'tinkering' with cosmological models, which the innumerable existing variations of inflationary models add up to, have been, from this perspective, appallingly and hopelessly sterile. There are those who -- intimidated by the admittedly daunting task of reconciling gravitation, cosmology, and quantum physics -- prefer to invoke metaphysical and theological arguments (such as the 'anthropic principle,' 'cosmic intention,' or 'divine intervention,') when dealing with issues of fundamental physics ... the ensuing confusion thrust upon physics and its demoralizing effect are immensely regrettable ... The telltale sign of a unification in depth is a more complete understanding of elementary objects and a wider reach to other fields and objects of physics.\"",
