    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Viscous drag between the charged particles and neutral atoms will tend to draw the neutral atoms towards the filament as well.\n\nTherefore, current filaments in space will tend accumulate matter in them as a result of the misalignment of the electric field causing the current and the total magnetic field.\n\nRemembering that pinches can occur if any misalignment of I and B occurs, any matter that has been drawn into the filament will also be compressed if a misalignment of I and B occurs. If the pinch force is large enough, it can fragment the filament into discrete spherical or toroidal plasmoids along the axis of the current. Any matter in the pinch zone would then become compressed into the same form ...\"",
