    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... The net result is that large masses have large gravitational forces for one another, but normally have negligible electrical forces between them.\n\nThe paradox is that although all matter is held together by electrical forces, of the interatomic or intermolecular or chemical-bond types, which are immensely strong forces, large objects are electrically neutral to a very high degree. The electrical balance between the numbers of protons and electrons is extraordinarily precise in all ordinary objects. To see how exact this balance is, Feynman has calculated that the repulsive force between two people standing at arm's length from each other who had 1% more electrons than protons in their bodies would be enormous â€“- enough in fact to repel a weight equal to that of the entire earth!\"",
