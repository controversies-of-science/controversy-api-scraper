It is possible to counter that if there were strong toroidal fields, then these would have prevented formation of the filament in the first place by blocking infall. Our answer: subcritical magnetic fields are there. Heiles (1997) measured their amplitude 20 yr ago and we have now shown they are subcritical by measuring the potential. Such high field strengths are naturally explained by magnetic compression of gas due to currents. That is, the material gets to its current position not by crossing field lines but by compressing them. It may be objected that this process would lead to pinching instabilities. Our answer: yes, pinching instabilities are expected and this is exactly what leads to cluster formation.\"",
