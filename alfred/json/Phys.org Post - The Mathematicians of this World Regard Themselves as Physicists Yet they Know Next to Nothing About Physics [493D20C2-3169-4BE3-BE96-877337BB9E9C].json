    "snippet" : "\"The mathematicians of this world regard themselves as 'physicists,' yet they know next to nothing about Physics. What is light? What is energy? What is time? What physical mechanism enables one magnet to attract another one? We have developed technology to unprecedented levels, but the mathematicians still offer irrational and fantastic physical explanations for even the most common phenomena.\n\nThe root of all the mathematical irrationalities we read about in the literature is traceable to the misconception that light is comprised of discrete particles. The mathematicians have also reified concepts, converting them into movable objects, and developed an incongruous language in an attempt to cover all the bases.\"\n\n- Bill Gaede, youstupidrelativist.com",
