Since those scientists have not investigated a particular new idea and do not have sound experimental or theoretical reasons to oppose the new idea, they may give conceptual reasons as to why the idea should not be investigated. There is always a reason not to investigate something if the researcher does not want to investigate that subject. Often, the reasons are really excuses, and these same reasons are ignored when those same scientists wish to investigate something else of interest to them.  Very little deters scientists from investigating what is of interest to them.\"",
