    "snippet" : "\"Faith is not a valid cognitive procedure. When it is accepted as such, the process of rational argumentation degenerates into a contest of whims, and any idea, no matter how absurd or evil, may be successfully defended by claiming that those who advocate it feel, somehow, that it is right. In such a philosophical environment ideas are accepted not on the basis of how logical they are but rather on the basis of how much 'feeling' their advocates seem to have. Unfortunately, the acceptance of ideas on this basis has been and continues to be the dominant epistemological trend in the world.\"\n\n- Dr. John C. Bortz of the University of Rochester",
