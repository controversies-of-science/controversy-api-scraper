If you think about it, the power that's expressed in your own home -- in the heaters, in the electric motors, and the lighting and so on, is actually generated at a vast distance away from your house.  In deep space, the same thing is true.  The energy which we see concentrated in these events which are attributed to black holes and so on can more easily be explained as the confluence of electric energy from different parts of the same galaxy or even from other parts of the universe.  And it is this explosive release of energy which forms the vast jets that we see lit up and exploding from the centers of active galaxies.\"",
