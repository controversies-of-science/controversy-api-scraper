    "snippet" : "\"In a penetrating essay called 'The Skepticism of Believers', Sir Leslie Stephen, a pioneering agnostic (and the father of Virginia Woolf), argued that skepticism is inevitably partial. 'In regard to the great bulk of ordinary beliefs, the so-called skeptics are just as much believers as their opponents.' Then as now, those who proclaim themselves skeptics had strong beliefs of their own. As Stephen put it in 1893, 'The thinkers generally charged with skepticism are equally charged with an excessive belief in the constancy and certainty of the so-called 'laws of nature'. They assign a natural cause to certain phenomena as confidently as their opponents assign a supernatural cause.'\"\n\n- Excerpted in The Times January 1, 2008 \"Science has second thoughts about life\"",
