By building up expectations that cannot be realised, such statements do a disservice not only to astronomy and to particle physics but they could ultimately do harm to the wider respect in which the whole scientific approach is held. As such, they must not go unchallenged.\"\n\n- Mike Disney, The Case against Cosmology, arXiv:astro-ph\/0009020 v1 1 Sep.2000",
