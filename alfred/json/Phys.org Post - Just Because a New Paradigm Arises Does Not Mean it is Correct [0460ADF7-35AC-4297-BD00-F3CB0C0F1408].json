Press, 1990) p.97-113\n\n\"Today's dominant view is not necessarily correct and indeed there almost certainly is some new view waiting to be recognized the precursors of that new view are probably already with us. On the other hand just because a new paradigm arises does not mean it is correct. The major message is that working scientists need to be aware of the pressures to conform and the strength of the bandwagon effect. There is a constant need to question and test the currently accepted foundations of cosmology and cosmological models.\"",
