    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Using the techniques of a comparative mythologist, Velikovsky began a comprehensive review of ancient texts from around the world dating from that same time period, and produced a body of supporting evidence that was more substantial than he at first imagined.\n\nThe ancient texts presented what he saw as a kind of universality of theme relating to reports of global calamity -- descriptions of,\n\n- fire raining from the sky\n- violent earthquakes\n- volcanoes erupting\n- displacement of great bodies of water,\n\n... and similar disasters of seeming mythic proportion.\n\nAt the same time he also began a search for references that might point to some real-world agent capable of inflicting the kinds of misfortunes described in the Book of Exodus. He eventually settled on the theoretic close approach of a comet to the Earth as the type of natural event that most closely fits the profile of destructive consequences described in the texts.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
