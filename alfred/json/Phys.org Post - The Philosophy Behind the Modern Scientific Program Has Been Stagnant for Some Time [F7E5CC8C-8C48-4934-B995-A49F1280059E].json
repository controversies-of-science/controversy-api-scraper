Present day understanding of the nature of gravity is mathematical and not physical. We think we know some 'Universal Laws', and that they are being tenured in the mathematical physics department, not the physical mathematics department. Increasing precision is manifest in our understanding of technological physics. On the contrary, in 1998 CODATA increased the uncertainty in relation to the natural physics associated with the measurement of G from 0.013% to 0.15%.\"",
