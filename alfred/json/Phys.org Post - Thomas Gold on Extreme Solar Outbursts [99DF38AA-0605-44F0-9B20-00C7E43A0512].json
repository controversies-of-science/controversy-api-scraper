    "snippet" : "\"The question I would like to tackle is whether solar outbursts of the present day are representative of all that has happened in geologic times or whether much greater outbursts have occurred from time to time. Our evidence that nothing very violent has taken place in historic times is concerned with such a short span of time only that it cannot answer the question. For one big outburst every ten thousand years, for example ... The earth's magnetic field could clearly not hold up the incoming gas, and it would indeed drive down to the atmospheric level ... This breakdown would be in the form of a series of sparks, burning for extended periods of time and carrying currents of hundreds of millions of amperes. One might search whether there is any geological record of surface fusing and vitrification of rock or sand which cannot be accounted for by volcanic or meteoritic events.\"\n\n- Thomas Gold",
