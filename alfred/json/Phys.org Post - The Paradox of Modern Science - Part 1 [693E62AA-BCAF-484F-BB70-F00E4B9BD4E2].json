On the one hand, science seems pervaded by relativism. An increasing number of philosophers have questioned the real contribution of science, accusing it of lacking a true methodology. They charge that aesthetic judgements, personal preferences, metaphysical prejudices, and subjective desires so taint the scientific method, at least in some of its phases, that it is no longer possible to vouch that it conforms to any rational process. Some even doubt the universal character of the rationality that drove science from the time of its Greek inception, and they go so far as to claim that it has no more legitimacy than ancient mythological beliefs [cf. Paul K Feyerabend Farewell to Reason, 1987] ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
