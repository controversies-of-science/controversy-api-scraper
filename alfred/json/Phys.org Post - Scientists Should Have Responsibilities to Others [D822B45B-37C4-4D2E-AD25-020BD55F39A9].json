    "snippet" : "\"I personally believe that because of their education and\/or gifts, scientists should have responsibilities to others. Scientists should, I believe, at all times be truthful and should never use their knowledge of science to deceive others. Moreover, scientists, I believe, have the responsibility to share their knowledge and to maintain the principles of science which make possible the determination of a kind of truth about nature that transcends human opinion. Regrettably, not all who call themselves scientists adhere to such standards.\"\n\n- J. Marvin Herndon, UnderstandUniverse.com",
