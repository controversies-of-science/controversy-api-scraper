    "snippet" : "Cosmology Has an Undeserved Reputation for Objectivity\n\nThe Cult of the Big Bang: Was There a Bang?\nWilliam C Mitchell\n(p171)\n\n\"In 1987 physicist Thomas S. Kuhn expressed the opinion that science is a political rather than a rational process.  In a recent Science News article Ivars Peterson reported that some historians, philosophers and sociologists 'argue that science has an undeserved reputation for objectivity.  They maintain that social interests determine not only how science is done but also its content.  Science itself is a matter of opinion â€“ decided on the basis of personal or political beliefs, they insist.  It is nothing but a social construction, perhaps even a group self delusion.'  Those opinions might be overly harsh regarding science in general, but they might apply to the field of cosmology where scientific method often seems to be considered an unnecessary annoyance.\"",
