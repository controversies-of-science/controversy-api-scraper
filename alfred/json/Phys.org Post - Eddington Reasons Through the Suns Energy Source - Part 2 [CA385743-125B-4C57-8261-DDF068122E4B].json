We must provide for the maintenance of the high internal temperature, without which the star would collapse. The temperature gradient from the surface to the centre cannot be maintained by supplying heat at the bottom end. If, for example, sufficient heat is developed by meteoric impact to maintain the surface of Capella at 5200', the temperature throughout the interior will fall gradually to this level and the star will no longer be distended to low density.\"",
