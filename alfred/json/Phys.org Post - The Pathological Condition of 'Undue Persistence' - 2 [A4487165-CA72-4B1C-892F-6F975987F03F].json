    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... This has two contradictory implications for scientific careers.  On the one hand, academic researchers actualize themselves through the acknowledged mastery of their respective research specialties.  It means a great deal psychologically to be the world authority on some particular scholarly matter, even if this is very pedantic and insignificant in relation to all the rest of knowledge.  But such a status does not last unless it is supported by the further contributions required to keep up with the moving frontier ...\n\nOn the other hand, academic specialization can lead to the pathological condition of 'undue persistence'.  Individual researchers often become unproductive and stale in mid-career, through trying to stay too long in the same narrow field.  This condition is not unknown in non-academic R&D organizations, but it is widespread in academic research, and probably wastes a great deal of research talent and experience.\"",
