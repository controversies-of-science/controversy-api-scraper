Alvarado's Critical Lives: The Life and Work of Thomas Edison (Alpha Books, 2002)\n\n\"Thomas Edison felt none too kindly about Nature, and so helped to set up Science, according to a biography of the US inventor published earlier this year. Shortly after the 33-year-old Edison demonstrated an incandescent bulb in 1879, Nature published an article alleging that he was 'thirty-five years behind the time in his new invention', citing an 1845 patent for a similar device held by the English inventor Edward King. After reading the comment, the enraged Edison decided secretly to underwrite Science. The journal published its first issue in 1880, and shortly thereafter wrote of Edison: 'While others have talked he has worked ... those who are competent can see and judge for themselves'\"",
