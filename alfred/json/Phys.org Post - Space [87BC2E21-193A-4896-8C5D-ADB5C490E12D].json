    "snippet" : "\"The most conspicuous property of space as we know it first hand is that it is three-dimensional. Of course there is much imaginative speculation about a fourth dimension, and mathematicians are fond of constructing hypothetical spaces of n dimensions, but the sector of the universe which we inhabit very definitely presents a three-dimensional aspect to our observation -- no more, no less. Additionally, space, as we find it, is homogeneous; that is, so far as we can tell, each unit is exactly like every other unit, and it is isotropic, that is, its behavior is the same in all directions.\"\n\n- Dewey B.
