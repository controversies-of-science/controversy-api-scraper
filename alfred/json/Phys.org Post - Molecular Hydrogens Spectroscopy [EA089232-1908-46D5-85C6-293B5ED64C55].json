    "snippet" : "\"Spectroscopy shows that molecular hydrogen is one of the most transparent gases in the universe.  It has no dipole transition in the radio range, in the infrared, in the visible, and even in the UV, up to the far UV. Even rotation and vibration states of the ground state cannot be observed because they are all forbidden dipole transitions.  The second and third UV lines of H2 are located at 109.2 and 107.7 nm.  Thanks to the transparence of H2 one is able to view the universe at very large distances.  However, H2 cannot be detected by spectroscopic means.  The only observable radiation from H2 at 3K is the wide Planck spectrum at its own temperature (already observed but erroneously interpreted as a background cosmic radiation).\"\n\n- Paul Marmet",
