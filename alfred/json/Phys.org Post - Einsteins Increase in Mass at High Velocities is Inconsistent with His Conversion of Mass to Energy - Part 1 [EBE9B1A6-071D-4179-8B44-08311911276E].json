    "snippet" : "\"Invoking the aid of auxiliary relations in an attempt to prove the conceptual validity of a hypothesis can work in reverse and furnish a disproof rather than a proof; indeed, this is the usual result, as the great majority of all theories that are proposed are conceptually wrong. The few that survive represent only a very small fraction of the number originally submitted for consideration. But here again the current tendency is to relax the standards for the benefit of the popular theories of the moment, and to ignore or 'explain away' contradictions and discrepancies, particularly if they appear in subordinate or collateral applications of the theory in question.\n\nThe current literature of science makes no reference, for instance, to the very obvious fact that Einstein's postulate of an increase in mass at high velocities, the one we have just been discussing, is wholly inconsistent with his explanation of the conversion of mass to energy ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
