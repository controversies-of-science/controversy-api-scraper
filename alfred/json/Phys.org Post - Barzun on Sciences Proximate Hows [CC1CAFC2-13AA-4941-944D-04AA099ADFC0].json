    "snippet" : "Jacques Barzun, Science: the glorious entertainment, p.287\n\n\"The clich√© that science tells How, not Why, is misleading. Science tells of proximate Hows. If, for example, 'life' could be synthesized in a test tube tomorrow, we should know how to do it again. But how it is that the ingredients come to this pass, or how it is that viruses seem borderline objects between life and the inorganic, cannot be told, because there is always for the mind a leap between knowing the parts and knowing the whole: it is the same leap as that between nerve action and consciousness.\"",
