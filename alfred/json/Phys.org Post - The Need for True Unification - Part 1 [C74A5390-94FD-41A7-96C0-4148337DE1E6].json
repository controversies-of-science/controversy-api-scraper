These concepts are almost like 'monsters', in the sense that they do not fit into the mainstream of any discipline taken individually ... This artificial cooperation between different disciplines underscores the need for true unification ... it is necessary to look for a new theory at the most fundamental level. Short of unifying gravity with the other interactions, it should at the very least provide a common descriptive framework ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
