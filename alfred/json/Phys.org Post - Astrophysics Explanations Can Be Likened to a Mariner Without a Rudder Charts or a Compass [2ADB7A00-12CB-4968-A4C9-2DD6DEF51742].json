    "snippet" : "\"The author has listened to some attempts by astrophysical theoreticians to explain the genesis of barred-spiral galaxies and the genesis of the gigantic galactic jets. Most of these attempts would remind a witness of the efforts of a mariner in a boat without a rudder, without charts, and without a compass. The mariner does not know how to get where he wants to go. This author is making the point that the plasma physics experiments in the laboratory will frequently point the way toward the winning hypotheses that will save the 'mariner' a great deal of time and effort (perhaps an infinite amount of time and hence his very life) in achieving his goals.\"\n\n- Winston Bostick, The Electromagnetic-Ram Action of the Plasma Focus As a Paradigm for the Production of Gigantic Galactic Jets and Cosmic Rays, International Journal of Fusion Energy, Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1985",
