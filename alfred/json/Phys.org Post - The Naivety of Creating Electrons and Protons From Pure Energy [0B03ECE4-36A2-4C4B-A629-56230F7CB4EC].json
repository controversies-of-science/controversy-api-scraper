    "snippet" : "\"... it seems hopelessly na√Øve to suppose that complex entities such as electrons and positrons, with spin, charge, and a number of other properties, could be 'created out of nothing' but 'pure energy.' This is like supposing that if we put a bunch of electronic components in a box, and shake them hard enough (i.e. add 'pure energy') the result will be a computer. 'Pure energy' can never supply the exact and specific information necessary to make the highly complex little entities that we call electron and positron. After all, we don't know how to make either electron or positron. What is 'electric charge?' We haven't a clue. Why are their spins quantized in half-integer values? No idea. Where do they get their immense, anomalous angular momentum? Beats us. And how on earth do they manage to pack all this into a zero or near zero radius? Yet we baldly suppose that 'pure energy' knows how to do all these things we can't do!\"\n\n- Don L. Hotson",
