    "snippet" : "\"The Sun has two measured global resonances -- a well-known '5-minute' resonance, and a '160-minute' resonance measured independently by two different teams of astronomers (Brooks et al., 1976; Severny et al., 1976). Their findings have been replicated by Scherrer and Wilcox at Stanford and by a French-American team (van der Ray, 1980) and the '160-minute' solar resonance shown to be stable over more than 1400 periods. The Russian group tracked the oscillation for more than four years. However, this resonance has been discounted and ignored because it does not fit the standard solar model. Time and again we find scientists saying, in effect, 'These are the theories on which I base my facts.' This is what the Churchmen told Galileo. Discounting measured data because it disagrees with a theory is the antithesis of science.\"\n\n- Don L. Hotson",
