This seemed unacceptable on two counts. In the first place, it seemed to be a form of 'action at a distance'. Perhaps no one has so elegantly expressed the objection to such a concept better than Sir Isaac Newton: 'That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of any thing else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to the other, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it.'
