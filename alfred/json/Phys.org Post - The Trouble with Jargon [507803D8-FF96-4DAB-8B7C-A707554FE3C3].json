    "snippet" : "\"Jargon-addiction, then, let's face it, is no more than a flagrant form of illiteracy. It is no more than the 'bar-bar-bar-' of a new barbarianism in which mere noise usurps the place of logical understanding. But of course, in the privacy of their own laboratories, consenting physicists may speak and do as they please. That, for many physicists, is what 'democracy' is all about. But when those beliefs and activities are sported in public -- in textbooks, for instance, or on prime-time TV -- that is anarchy, especially if it corrupts the young and tender-minded into thinking that this kind of jargon is, or should be, the norm.\"\n\n- UMBALA - A Polemic Against Jargon-Addiction in Modern Physics, Viv Pope, Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Meeting of the Alternative Natural Philosophy Association (ANPA, Cambridge UK)",
