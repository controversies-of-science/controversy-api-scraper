    "snippet" : "\"Following Donald Rumsfeld, Feynman diagrams depict at least three types of beasts. There are the known knowns: particles like quarks and gluons that surely exist in our world. Others are the known unknowns: gauge-artifact 'ghosts' that exist only in physicists' imaginations, and are not meant to represent real stuff in the world. And then there are all those superpartners, the unknown unknowns.\"\n\n- David Kaiser, The Sacred, Spherical Cows of Physics, Nautilus May 1, 2014",
