    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"But Taylor's observations of Venus would mean that the planet is producing almost 10,000 times more heat than the Earth -- and it is inconceivable, according to present theories of planetary formation, that Venus should have thousands of times more of the radioactive elements than the Earth does.  At last week's meeting, Taylor's suggestion met with scepticism -- not to say sheer disbelief -- from other planetary scientists.\n\nTaylor himself has no explanation for his result.  He simply points out that the discrepancy seemed at first to be simply experimental error -- but with more precise measurement it refused to go away.  More measurements are needed before astronomers accept the result, and most planetary scientists are obviously expecting -- and hoping -- that the embarrassing extra heat will disappear on further investigation.\"",
