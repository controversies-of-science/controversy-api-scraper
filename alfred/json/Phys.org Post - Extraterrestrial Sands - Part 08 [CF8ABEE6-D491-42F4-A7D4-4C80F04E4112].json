    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"The clay particles may have first adhered to the quartz grains as a result of being higher in the atmosphere followed by the attraction of iron oxides at lower levels. It may also be that once the hydrous (containing water) clay film formed, it allowed iron oxides to accrete or condensate on the surface of the grains. Another idea would be the iron oxides took on a negative charge as opposed to a positive one and thee were attracted to positively charged clay particles.\"",
