Within the framework of standard theory, no force is present to drive the upper winds around the planet at such a speed, since Venus itself has a rotational period of 243 days retrograde and the planet's lower winds are exceptionally sluggish. Since the planet is the same temperature overall there is no temperature gradient to drive the winds.\"",
