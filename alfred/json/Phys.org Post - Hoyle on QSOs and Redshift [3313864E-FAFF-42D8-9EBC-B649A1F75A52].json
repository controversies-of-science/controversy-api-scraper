That some kinds of extragalactic objects, mostly QSOs, are physically associated with apparently normal galaxies of stars, but often have large redshifts compared with the galaxies ... either the galaxies were ejected from the QSO's, or the QSO's were ejected from the galaxies. We consider it more likely that the latter hypothesis is correct. Once this premise is accepted it follows [that] cosmological investigations based on QSO redshifts cannot be taken seriously since luminosity distances cannot be determined from the observed QSO redshifts unless the magnitudes of the intrinsic redshift components are known.\"",
