    "snippet" : "\"We cannot determine the true reason for the decrease in acceleration at high velocities by a study of this phenomenon alone; we must have at least one independent but related phenomenon which can be utilized together with the behavior of high velocity particles in a manner similar to the solving of a set of simultaneous equations. Usually it will take an even larger set of auxiliary relationships in this kind of a situation than would be expected on the basis of the number of unknowns that appear to be involved, because these physical relations do not have the exact parallelism that characterizes simultaneous mathematical equations, and furthermore, it is not always easy to determine in advance just how many unknowns enter into the situation.\"\n\n- Dewey B.
