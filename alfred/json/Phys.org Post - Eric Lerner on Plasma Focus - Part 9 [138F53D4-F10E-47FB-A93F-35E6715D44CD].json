    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... But how can a galaxy generate an electrical current? I knew about disk generators and calculated that a galaxy rotating in a magnetic field will generate a current flowing toward its center sufficient to power vast plasmoids -- a process Alfven had proposed four years earlier, I later found out. Since the currents must flow out along the axis, they will arc around, as in the plasma focus -- a similar geometry leads to plasmoid formation in both cases.\n\nWhile these ideas were crystallizing I was also studying the evidence, accumulating since 1978, for the existence of filament-like superclusters of galaxies ... Why couldn't these filaments of galaxies be larger versions of the filaments in the plasma focus and the filaments that I hypothesized to form in galaxies? They would produce magnetic fields in which galaxies, as they rotate, would produce the plasmoids that make up quasars or active galactic nuclei.\"",
