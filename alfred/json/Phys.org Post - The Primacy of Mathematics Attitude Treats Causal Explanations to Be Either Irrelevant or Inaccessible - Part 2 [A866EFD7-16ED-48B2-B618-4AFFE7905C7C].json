    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"It is perhaps necessary to clarify exactly what the problem with 20th century physics is and what it is not. The problem is emphatically not that the equations of contemporary physics are wrong, nor even that the equations were discovered before the underlying causal mechanisms were understood. Historically, it is the normal progression for a regularity in nature to be observed and quantified mathematically before the underlying causes are identified ... Thus the problem with contemporary physics is not simply that we have equations without yet knowing the causal mechanisms behind them. That is the current state of affairs, but it is a normal, intermediate stage in the growth of knowledge. Rather, the problem is that physicists have abandoned the attempt to discover causal mechanisms. Such explanations of the equations are regarded as unimportant or impossible.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
