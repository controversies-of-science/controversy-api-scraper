    "snippet" : "E. R. Dobbs, Electricity and Magnetism, (1984), p.2-3\n\n\"Although both the gravitational and electrical force obey an inverse square law, their size differs enormously. For the proton-electron pair which comprises the hydrogen atom, the electrical force is about 10^39 or one thousand million million million million million million times as strong as the gravitational force ... So we can nearly always neglect gravitational effects in the presence of electrical forces.\n\n...The gravitational and electrical forces also differ in one other important respect: the gravitational force between particles of ordinary matter is always attractive, whereas the electrical force is repulsive between like charges and attractive between unlike charges ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
