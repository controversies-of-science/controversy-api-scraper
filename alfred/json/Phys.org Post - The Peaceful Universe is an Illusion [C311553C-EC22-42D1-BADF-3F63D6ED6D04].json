Right now, our Sun is a wonderfully peaceful star. At first glance, looking up at the sky, the heavens appear very peaceful, very tranquil. But the more closely you look, the wilder, the more potentially violent the world of the stars turns out to be. For example, the visible Universe has innumerable variable stars, many of which can suddenly increase their light output by many times for a few hours, then go back again. Some pulse regularly. Some do it once in a while. If our Sun did anything like that, we'd all be gone.\"",
