The first referee reached the conclusion that the observations had been made correctly, but there must be something the matter with the statistical analysis. So this paper was sent to a second referee, a distinguished statistician who worked on astronomical problems ... That referee reached the conclusion that the statistical analysis had been done correctly, but that there must be something wrong with the observations.\"",
