Since he was living there, the geography would have been easy; but I had heard that Einstein was not too well and that he was exposed to a never-ending stream of visitors. I asked Schwarzschild for advice on what I should do, aware that, because of his father, Martin would know Einstein well. He asked for a day or two to think about the matter. Eventually, he said it would be a kindness to desist. So I did, which was why I never met Einstein.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
