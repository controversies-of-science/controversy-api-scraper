    "snippet" : "\"We're dealing with universities and laboratories acting as 'fact factories' (yawn, see Kuhn), except unlike a good factory, they have deficiencies in their Quality Assurance. One way around this could be for papers to be published with statements by the referees saying exactly what has and (more importantly) has not, been checked. This is standard in safety critical industry. In science, this checking comes about by the repeating of experiments, observations or calculations, but is a much slower process, and in fact, often no such checks are made ... Luckily, scientists alone don't construct aeroplanes.\"\n\n- Thomas Gold",
