And for the most part they did so despite lacking a proper understanding of the expeditionary data. Clearly, then, in this case much of the scientific community was prepared to endorse interpretations without being able to justify their decision on empirical grounds. Furthermore, most scientists subsequently stood by this position irrespective of the later publication of eclipse data that did not corroborate Eddington’s figures.
