    "snippet" : "Jacques Barzun, Science: the glorious entertainment, p.26-7\n\n\"What is new among the conditions of knowledge is the result of what is usually called specialization, but should rather be called specialism. Specialization -- attending to one thing at a time, and for as long a time as will insure thoroughness -- is obviously desirable and it is not a modern invention. Specialism is something else: it is a piece of etiquette which decrees that no specialist shall bother with the concerns of another, lest he be thought intruding and be shown up as ignorant. Specialism is born of what the philosopher Arthur Balfour called 'the pernicious doctrine that superficial knowledge is worse that no knowledge at all.'\"",
