    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Now the atmospheres of planets like Venus, Earth and Mars are composed primarily of gases that originated in the planets themselves. Argon‐40, for example, is generated by the radioactive decay of potassium‐40. In Earth's atmosphere, there is 300 times as much argon‐40 as argon‐36, and even that is a minute fraction of 1 percent of the total atmosphere. On Venus, according to the Pioneer mass spectrometer, there are almost equal amounts of argon‐3б and argon‐40 ...\n\n'I cannot account for the values I'm getting' ...\n\nWhatever the reason for the discrepancy between the two experiments, Dr. Donahue said the data indicate that primordial argon is either 100 times as abundant on Venus as on Earth — according to the gas chromatograph — or 500 times as abundant, according to the mass spectrometer.\"",
