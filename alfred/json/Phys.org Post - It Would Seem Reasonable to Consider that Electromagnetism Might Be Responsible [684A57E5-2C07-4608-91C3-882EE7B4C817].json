    "snippet" : "\"Most people when they paint themselves into a corner will admit their mistake and splash their way out. Mainstream cosmologists turn round and dismantle the corner brick by brick until the building comes down on top of them.\n\nFaced with observations of the motion of galaxies that can't be explained by gravity alone, it would seem reasonable to consider the possibility that electromagnetism might be responsible. After all, since science began physicists have been able to find only four different types of force: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces, the last two of which act only at very small sub-atomic distances. Unfortunately however, there is less kudos in working with the classical physics of electromagnetism than in an exposition of some unexpected consequence of general relativity, and general relativity only deals with gravity.\"\n\n- Harry Nielsen, Crisis in Cosmology",
