    "snippet" : "\"Plasma is not a gas, liquid, or solid -- it is the fourth state of matter.  Plasma often behaves like a gas, except that it conducts electricity and is affected by magnetic fields. On an astronomical scale, plasma is common. The Sun is composed of plasma, fire is plasma, fluorescent and neon lights contain plasma.\n\n'99.99 percent of the Universe is made up of plasma,' says Dr. Dennis Gallagher, a plasma physicist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. 'Very little material in space is made of rock like the Earth.'\"\n\n(NASA Science News - Plasma, Plasma, Everywhere - A New Model of the Plasmasphere Surrounding Our World, at http:\/\/science.nasa.gov\/science-news\/science-at-nasa\/1999\/ast07sep99_1\/)",
