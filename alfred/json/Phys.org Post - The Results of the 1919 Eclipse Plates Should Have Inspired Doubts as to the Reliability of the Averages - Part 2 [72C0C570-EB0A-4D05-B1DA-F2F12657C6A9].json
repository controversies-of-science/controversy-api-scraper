    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... The Sobral team’s astrograph shots were of a lower quality, but 18 of them were used to calculate an average of 0.86 seconds. In other words, one set of photographs was close to Einstein’s prediction, the other was very close to the Newtonian value of 0.8. Unfortunately the first score was too high to be strictly compatible with general relativity and the score in the second set was based on low-quality exposures. In addition, each set of photographs involved very large standard errors. This should have immediately prompted doubts as to the reliability of the averages themselves.\"",
