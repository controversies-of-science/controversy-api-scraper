After all, the world is full of crazy notions, notions the public keep on buying, as Barnum's remark about a sucker being born every minute makes clear. I suppose I passed the situation off with the thought that Americans are highly emotional people, which, in some degree, is true. But is it sufficiently true to explain why Harlow Shapley, a most distinguished astronomer, was prepared to parade himself on the national stage over what was claimed to be nothing but claptrap? Or could it be that Velikovsky had revealed, admittedly in a form that was scientifically unacceptable, a situation that astronomers are under a cultural imperative to hide? Could it be that, somewhere in the shadows, there is a past history that it is inadmissible to discuss?\"",
