    "snippet" : "\"The whole point of science is that most of it is uncertain. That's why science is exciting -- because we don't know. Science is all about things we don't understand. The public, of course, imagines science is just a set of facts. But it's not. Science is a process of exploring, which is always partial. We explore, and we find out things that we understand. We find out things we thought we understood were wrong. That's how it makes progress.\"\n\n- Freeman J. Dyson, Huffington Post 6 May 2014",
