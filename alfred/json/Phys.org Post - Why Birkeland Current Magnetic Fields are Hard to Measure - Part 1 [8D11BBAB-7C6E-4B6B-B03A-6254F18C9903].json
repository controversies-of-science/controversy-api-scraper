    "snippet" : "Juan Calsiano explains:\n\n\"With respect to cosmic magnetic fields, if the electrical currents are truly vast, then the magnetic fields should be also truly vast. The measurements are not showing this. Not only the detected magnitudes tend to be very small (for what one may expect for cosmic objects), but also there is a lack of an azimuthal magnetic field around the filament.\n\nAgain, the solution is to analyze the Physics behind appearances. The Lundquist-Scott model of Birkeland Currents provides great insight into the Physics behind BCs. And it was Jim Weninger who first understood what may be going on here. Let me paste here an extract from my summary of his break-room presentation during the EU2016 Conference ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
