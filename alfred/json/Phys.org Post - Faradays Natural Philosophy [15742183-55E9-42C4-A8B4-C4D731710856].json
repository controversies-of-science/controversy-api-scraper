    "snippet" : "The Electric Life of Michael Faraday by Alan Hirshfeld, page 65.\n\n\"In his fifth lecture, he suspended the didactic narrative to declare his core scientific philosophy: 'The [natural] philosopher should be a man willing to listen to every suggestion, but determined to judge for himself. He should not be biassed by appearances; have no favorite hypothesis; be of no school; and in doctrine have no master. He should not be a respecter of persons, but of things. Truth should be his primary object. If to these qualities be added industry, he may indeed hope to walk with the veil of the temple of nature.'\"",
