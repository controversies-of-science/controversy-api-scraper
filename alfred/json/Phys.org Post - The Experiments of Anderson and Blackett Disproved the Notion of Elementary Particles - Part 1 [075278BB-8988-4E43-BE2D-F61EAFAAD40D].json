    "snippet" : "Werner Heisenberg, one of the most prominent physicists of this century, makes the following remarks in his article titled \"The nature of elementary particles\":\n\n\"... Before this time it was assumed that there were two fundamental kinds of particles, electrons and protons, which, unlike most other particles, were immutable. Therefore their number was fixed and they were referred to as 'elementary' particles. Matter was seen as being ultimately constructed of electrons and protons. The experiments of Anderson and Blackett provided definite proof that this hypothesis was wrong. Electrons can be created and annihilated; their number is not constant; they are not 'elementary' in the original meaning of the word ... A proton could be obtained from a neutron and a pion, or a hyperon and a kaon, or from two nucleons and one antinucleon, and so on. Could we therefore simply say a proton consists of continuous matter? ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
