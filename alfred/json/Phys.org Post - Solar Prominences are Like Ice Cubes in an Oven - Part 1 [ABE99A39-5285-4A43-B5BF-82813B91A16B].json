Since it emits the characteristic visible spectrum of hydrogen atoms, we know its temperature must lie around 10,000 kelvin, while all around it, the corona rages at 2 million kelvin.  Common sense suggests the prominence should evaporate instantly, but it doesn't.\n\nBy laboratory standards, a prominence is nearly a complete vacuum, with a plasma density of less than 1011 atoms per cubic centimeter.  But despite its lacy appearance, a prominence is a hundred times as dense as the corona around it ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
