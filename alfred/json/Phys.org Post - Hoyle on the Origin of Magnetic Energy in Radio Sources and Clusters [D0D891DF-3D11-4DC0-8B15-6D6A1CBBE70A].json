It must be argued that after ejection of magnetic flux from the centers of active galaxies, instead of getting weaker, it is amplified by turbulent action involving the much lower density, but much faster moving, hot intergalactic gas, but no quantitative theory demonstrating this has been developed, and we find it extremely difficult to understand.\"",
