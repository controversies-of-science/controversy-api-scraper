    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... Cohen and Gabrielle (1982) first reported that the fungi Polyporus versicolor and Poria montiola could degrade lignite. The fungus Polyporus versicolor, which is the common species involved in the rotting of wood, incorporates atmospheric CO2 during its growth and thereby introduces C14 into the coal substrate. Once the coal specimen is contaminated, fungi and microorganisms may be killed by conventional methods such as autoclaving, but the fungal hyphae and waste products, which contain C14 derived from atmospheric CO2, will be almost impossible to remove by standard chemical washing procedures. Assuming that a sample of coal contains no C14, microbial action only has to result in the deposition of ca 0.1% by weight of modern carbon in the coal to produce an apparent age of 45 kyr for the specimen.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
