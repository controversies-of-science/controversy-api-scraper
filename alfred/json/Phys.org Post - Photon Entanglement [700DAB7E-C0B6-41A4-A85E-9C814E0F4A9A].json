In such a case, it is not permissible to consider them as distinct entities. The global character of their behavior precludes any explanation in terms of independent photons, each with its own well-defined physical properties. It is as though the two particles remain connected by an invisible link that depends neither on space nor on time, and they cannot be conceptually separated. Any action exerted on one has an instantaneous effect on the other, no matter how great the distance separating them.\"",
