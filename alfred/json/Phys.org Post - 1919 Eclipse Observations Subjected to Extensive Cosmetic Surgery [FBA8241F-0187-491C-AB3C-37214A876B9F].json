    "snippet" : "Eddington Subjected 1919 Eclipse Observations to \"Extensive Cosmetic Surgery\" Until they Matched Einstein's Prediction\n\nFabulous Science Fact and Fiction in the History of Scientific Discovery\nJohn Waller\n(p57)\n\n\"The Sobral and Principe expeditions most certainly did not produce measurements that could definitively confirm either Newtonian or Einsteinian theory. In his book The Physical Foundations of General Relativity (1972), the British astronomer Dennis Sciama explained that eclipse observations are notoriously ‘hard to assess ... since other astronomers have derived different results from a re-discussion of the same material’. In this case, there can be no doubt at all that both theories could potentially have been declared victorious ... But this is not what happened. Under Eddington’s hand, the eclipse results were subjected to extensive cosmetic surgery until they matched Einstein’s prediction. Without this treatment Einstein could not have been vindicated in 1919.\"",
