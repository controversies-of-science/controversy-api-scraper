    "snippet" : "\"The Remedy. The blocking of new information by all our institutions means the end of civilisation. It is of the utmost importance that the facts of the situation be established soon and that remedial action be taken. The remedy is simple -- to introduce accountability. I fear that at present a knowledge broker is rewarded for blocking new information. The necessary reform will be that should a knowledge broker be proved to have blocked new information, he will be dismissed.\"\n\n- Ivor Catt",
