    "snippet" : "\"Whilst remaining, I hope, broad-minded I must express strong doubts about the desirability of including discussions of some aspects of the 'Lunatic fringe'.

'Neocatastrophism' is, in my view, a valid scientific hypothesis that deserves more careful attention by geologists, but we will not acquire scientific respectability if we associate ourselves with Atlantis-hunters or, for that matter, flat-earthers!\" \n\n- Derek V.
