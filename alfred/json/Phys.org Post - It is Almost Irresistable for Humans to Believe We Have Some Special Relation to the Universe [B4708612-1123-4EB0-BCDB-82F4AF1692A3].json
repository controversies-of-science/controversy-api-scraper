Then, after reflecting that the vastness and beauty of the Wyoming landscape he was observing from his airplane seat at 33,000 feet was '... just a tiny part of an overwhelmingly hostile universe.' he continues this theme, saying '... It is even harder to realize that this present universe has evolved from an unspeakably unfamiliar early condition and faces a future extinction of endless cold or intolerable heat.'\"",
