[75]  Morever, this situation prevailed from long before the Tertiary period as Elso Barghoorn indicated: 'From the paleontological evidence available, it would appear that there was very slight climatic zonation between high and low latitudes during the major part of the Carboniferous.' [76]\n\nThere was thus an added problem that confronted paleobotanists.  How could Earth's polar regions been blessed with a sub-tropical climate while the rest of the world remained little, if at all, warmer than it is at present?  As Barbara Bell admitted: 'It is by no means clear that solar radiation sufficiently intense to keep the poles as warm as they appear to have been at times would not heat the tropics more than observations indicate.'
