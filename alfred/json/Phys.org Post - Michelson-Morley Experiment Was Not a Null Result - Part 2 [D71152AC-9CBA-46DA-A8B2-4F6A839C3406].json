    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... 'The brief series of observations was sufficient to show that the effect did not have the anticipated magnitude. However, and this fact must be emphasized, the indicated effect was not zero; the sensitivity of the apparatus was such that the conclusion, published in 1887, stated that the observed relative motion of the earth and ether did not exceed one-fourth of the Earth's orbital velocity. This is quite different from a null effect now so frequently imputed to this experiments by the writers on Relativity. Miller then discusses the original Michelson-Morley data and shows that there is a systematic effect indicating a speed of the Earth relative to the Ether of 8.8 km\/s for the noon observations and 8.0 km\/s for the evening observations.'\"\n\n(the original source for this quote is difficult to track down)",
