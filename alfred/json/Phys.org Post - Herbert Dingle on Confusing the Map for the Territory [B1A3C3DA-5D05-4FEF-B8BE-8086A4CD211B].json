    "snippet" : "Herbert Dingle, Nature Vol. 244, August 31 1973, p.568\n\n\"It is now easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a mathematical physicist to conceive that whatever is possible for his symbols is not of necessity possible for physical bodies. No state of mind can, in present circumstances (or, morally, in any circumstances) be more ominous than that which this controversy has shown to be practically universal among these practitioners. Once more I beg those -- be they physicists, biologists, or public men of any description -- in whose power it lies, to read the unmistakable signs of the times and take such steps as will ensure that in science the traditional absolute authority of reason and experience over automatic adherence to any theory, however attractive and temporarily successful, is restored before the inevitable consequences of neglecting that duty come upon us.\"",
