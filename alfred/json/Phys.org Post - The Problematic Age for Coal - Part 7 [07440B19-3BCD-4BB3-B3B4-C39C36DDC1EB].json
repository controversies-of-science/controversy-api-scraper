This then led to a new theory according to which such trees, once fallen, would have been carted away by overflowing rivers.  This could explain why, in some areas, tree trunks have been found embedded in coal seams in an upright position with their roots uppermost.  It does not, however, explain why other trunks have also been found upright in their original growing position with their roots still in the ground, unrotted and uncarbonized.  In both cases, one is left to wonder why these trunks were not themselves turned into coal.\n\nYet another objection focuses on the fact that some of these individual coal seams are as much as fifty or more feet thick.  This would then have required the compression of a plant matter the original thickness of which would have measured thousands of feet ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
