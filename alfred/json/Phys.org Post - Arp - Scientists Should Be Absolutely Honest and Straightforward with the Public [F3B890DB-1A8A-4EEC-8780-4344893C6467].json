    "snippet" : "\"One lesson from all of this, which seems obvious, is that scientists have to be absolutely honest and straightforward with the public, the people who are paying their salary. Their primary moral obligation is to report the facts and make available a range of interpretations. They have no paternalistic excuse to guard the public from ‘misunderstandings’ or ‘alarm.’ If they cannot explain a matter so that a non-specialist can understand it, they don’t understand it themselves and should not cover up this important situation.\"\n\n- Halton Arp, Seeing Red, p.266",
