    "snippet" : "\"Alfvén’s approach to science follows the prediction-testing method advocated by Popper and other philosophers of science, and is quite similar to the 'methodology of scientific research programmes' described by Imre Lakatos. By Popperian criteria his theories should have acquired credit by their successful predictions, and by Lakatosian standards his programme should be considered 'progressive.' Yet most of the scientific community refuses to follow it or to give Alfvén credit for his achievements although many of his basic concepts are now accepted.\"\n\n- Stephen G. Brush",
