    "snippet" : "Herbert Dingle, The Scientific Outlook in 1851 and in 1951, The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Vol II, August, 1951, No. 6, p.103\n\n\"The discarding of an old prejudice and the cultivation of a new outlook are not matters that can be completed in a moment. One first catches a glimpse of a new way of regarding things, and begins to see a few outstanding features of his surroundings in a new light. But he does not immediately realise that the whole scene has been transformed. Deep-seated beliefs remain, incompatible with the new outlook though they may be, and only gradually begin to take on a strange appearance and arouse misgivings. For a long time, like Copernicus, to whom the heliocentric doctrine never succeeded in showing the unreality of the celestial spheres, he unconsciously maintains two inconsistent attitudes, and in all good faith harbours beliefs fundamentally at variance with one another.\"",
