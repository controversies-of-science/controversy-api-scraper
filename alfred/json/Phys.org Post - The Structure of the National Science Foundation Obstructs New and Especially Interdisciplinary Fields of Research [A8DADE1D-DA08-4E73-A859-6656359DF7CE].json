    "snippet" : "\"The structure of the National Science Foundation, with well-defined and separate directorates and divisions, and with most contracts controlled by individual program directors (who are often reluctant to allocate their funds to other programs), places enormous obstacles to the support of new, and especially interdisciplinary fields of research. Although the NSF is eloquent in its appreciation of interdisciplinary research, it has not been able to overcome these obstacles or make the structural changes necessary to do so.\"\n\n- David J.
