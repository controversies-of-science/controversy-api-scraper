    "snippet" : "\"Feynman, who originated the 'renormalization' process (with Schwinger and Tomonaga), himself called it a '... shell game ... Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-consistent ... [renormalization] is what I would call a dippy process!' (Feynman, 1985) Asked for what he had won the Nobel Prize, Feynman replied, 'For sweeping them [the infinities] under the rug ... like the freshman that looks up the correct values in the back of the book, we fudge the answers. A student who pulled such a stunt would flunk. The three famous professors who pulled it shared a Nobel Prize.' (Gleick, 1992).\"\n\n- Don L. Hotson",
