    "snippet" : "Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., The Geometrisation of Physics, and its supposed Basis on the Michelson-Morley Experiment. Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.797\n\n\"... if a special geometry has to be invented in order to account for a falling apple, even Newton might be appalled at the complications which would ensue when really difficult problems are tackled. Nevertheless, that is the kind of geometry to which relativity introduces us -- a geometry based on hypothetical laboratory measurements with scales and clocks, and one of the propositions of which can be interfered with by metrical observations. It is therefore sometimes called a 'natural' geometry, free from metaphysics; it might equally well be called an abstract sort of theoretical physics, and not geometry at all.\"",
