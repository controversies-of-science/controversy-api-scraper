    "snippet" : "Herbert Dingle's Reply to McCrea's Criticism, compiled from 'The Case against the Special Theory of Relativity', Nature, 217:19-20 (Jan. 6, 1968)\n\n\"It is the general view that Relativity is beyond the understanding of most, but must be accepted because some mathematicians, who alone understand it, endorse it. Criticism of it, being on this view merely a sign of incomprehension, can therefore be ignored if a sufficiently imposing mathematical dismissal, intelligible or not, is forthcoming.\n\nI distinguish clearly between a) the mathematics and b) the identification of the mathematical symbols with observable quantities. I have enough mathematical insight to see that it is a waste of time to look for mathematical flaws in the theory.\"",
