This is what all of the observers like to assume, but from an observational point of view they may well be coming apart. Presumably the prejudice towards merging is based on the idea that gravity is the only force acting. But if explosive events are clearly seen, even if we do not understand them, the possibility that objects are separating rather than merging must be considered.\"",
