    "snippet" : "\"We of the present generation are too impatient to wait for anything. Within thirty years of Michelson’s failure to detect the expected motion of the earth with respect to the ether we have wiped out the slate, made a postulate that by no means whatever can the thing be done, and constructed a non Newtonian mechanics to fit the postulate. The success which has been attained is a marvellous tribute to our intellectual activity and our ingenuity, but I am not so sure with respect to our judgement.\"\n\n- Max Born, \"Einstein’s Relativity\" (1962)",
