To my great surprise the opposite has occurred: the 'merging' pseudoscience seems to be increasingly powerful.  Magnetospheric physics and solar wind physics today are no doubt in a chaotic state, and a major reason for this is that part of the published papers are science and part pseudoscience, perhaps even with a majority in the latter group.\"\n\n[1] Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics, IEEE Trans.
