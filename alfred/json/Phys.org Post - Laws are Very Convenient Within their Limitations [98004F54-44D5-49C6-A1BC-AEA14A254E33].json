    "snippet" : "\"Voltage is proportional to current, over a limited range.  The stretch of a spring is proportional to the tension, but the 'law' runs out of steam long before the spring is pulled into a straight piece of wire.  And these laws are very convenient within their limitations, allowing measurements to be predicted and experiments to be second-guessed.  It's when the law takes on the flavour of a UNIVERSAL TRUTH that the scientist is transformed into a credulist.  A highly regarded spokesman for the credulists said recently 'isn't it wonderful that an electron can be both a particle and a wave at the same time?'  This is daftly saying 'isn't it wonderful that a platypus can be at the same time both a beaver and a duck?'  The credulists have got it wrong again -- the electron is neither particle nor wave -- think again!\"\n\n- Prof. John Billingsley",
