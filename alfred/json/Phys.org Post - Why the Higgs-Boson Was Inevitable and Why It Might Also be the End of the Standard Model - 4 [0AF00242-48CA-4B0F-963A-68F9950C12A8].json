    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... The reason we have two experiments ... looking for the Higgs boson is because if one experiment makes a discovery, then the other can confirm or refute the discovery ... so when one experiment sees an effect, but its counterpart doesn't, then it's likely due to a problem with analysis. In an experiment as complicated as [this] ... it's not surprising that something subtle would get missed.  Everything the hardware and software was telling the physicist was there was a bump [observed] in distribution.  The easiest way to see if this is wrong is to see what [other] ... hardware and software tell us. It turns out they disagree in this instance and we got the crosscheck needed ...\n\nIf we combine measurements from two different experiments we end up losing the vital crosscheck ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
