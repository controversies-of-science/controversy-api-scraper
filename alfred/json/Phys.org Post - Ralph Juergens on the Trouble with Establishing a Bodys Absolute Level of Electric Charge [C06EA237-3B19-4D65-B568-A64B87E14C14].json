    "snippet" : "Ralph E. Juergens, Forum, Kronos Vol V No. II, 1980\n\n\"In my study of cosmic processes I find that the absolute level of electric charge on a body is indeterminate in the same manner as the inability to determine absolute linear motion. Einstein showed that, since the Universe contains no marker stating this point is at rest, it is not possible to determine motion or rest except by referring to some other body. Likewise, I find that measurement of charge-level is hindered by the absence of a marker denoting that this point is electrically neutral. For motion we can detect change; acceleration gives rise to a 'force of reaction'. Similarly, when charge-levels are altered we can observe a mechanical reaction; rotational glitches are noted when the charge-state of a rotating body is altered. They are, unfortunately, the only detected clue that we reside on an electrically-charged Earth.\"",
