    "snippet" : "\"Courtroom experience during my career at the bar taught me to attach great weight to something that may seem trivial to persons not skilled in argumentation -- the burden of proof. The proponents of a theory, in science or elsewhere, are obligated to support every link in the chain of reasoning, whereas a critic or skeptic may peck at any aspect of the theory, testing it for flaws. He is not obligated to set up any theory of his own or to offer any alternative explanations. He can be purely negative if he so desires.\"\n\n- Norman Macbeth, Springfield, Vermont",
