    "snippet" : "\"There is a fairly large body of evidence which supports the idea of a strong relationship, and possibly an equivalent fundamental source, for electromagnetism and gravitation. Many references to this effect are contained in this resource list. But for now, let's forget about the experimental evidence and theoretical ideas which are presented here, and begin with first principles. \n\nWhat if our knowledge of physics had evolved differently? \n\nWhat if no one had ever given a thought to any theory of gravitation, before we discovered the principles and theories of electromagnetics and the two nuclear forces. We might have developed some fairly good theories which unify the 'three' forces. We would know that clumps of matter are held together primarily by electromagnetic forces. And we would find experimentally that if we separate some of these clumps of matter, a small force continues to exist which tries to bring them back together ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
