    "snippet" : "\"... astronomers habitually refer to the 'evolution' of stars and galaxies, but a closer parallel with biological usage would be achieved if the word 'development' were used instead. The entities studied by astronomers -- stars, galaxies, and the like -- manifest a trend toward enhanced complexity and differentiation, just as a growing animal or plant does. But stellar and galactic astronomy offer no analogue of Darwinian evolution by natural selection.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.80",
