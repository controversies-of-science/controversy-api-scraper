    "snippet" : "The Electric Universe (2007)\n\n\"[I]n their discussion of plasma phenomena, astrophysicists continue to refer to plasma as a gas, and their descriptions of celestial events draw upon the language of wind and water, an invitation to scientific confusion: plasma discharge follows different rules from those governing the behavior of either gases or liquids.\n\nAstrophysicists are not trained in electrodynamics, circuit theory, or plasma discharge phenomenona. Such things would render their gravitational models obsolete and require practical experiments outside the areas of their expertise. They continue to rely on gas and magnetized-fluid physics that is mathematically well-mannered. They seem not to consider that our insulated home at the bottom of an ionosphere on a small rocky planet presents an illussion of electrical neutrality. In truth, our Earth is part of a complex electric universe ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
