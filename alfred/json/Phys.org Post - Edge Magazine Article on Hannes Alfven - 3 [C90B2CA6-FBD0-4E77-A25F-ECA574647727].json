All large scale events in space could still be explained in terms of disconnected islands, and it would only be necessary to look inside the \"islands\" to discover localized electromagnetic eventsâ€”no larger electric currents or circuitry required. In this view, popularly held today, we live in a 'magnetic universe' (the title of several recent books and articles), but not an electric universe. The point was stated bluntly by the eminent solar physicist Eugene Parker, '... No significant electric field can arise in the frame of reference of the moving plasma.'\"\n\n(cont'd)",
