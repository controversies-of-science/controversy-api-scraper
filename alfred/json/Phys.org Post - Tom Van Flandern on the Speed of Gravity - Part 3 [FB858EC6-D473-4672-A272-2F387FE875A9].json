They have been raised and answered thousands of times in dozens of different ways over the years since general relativity (GR) was set forth in 1916. Even today [writing in 1998] in discussions of gravity in USENET newsgroups on the Internet, the most frequently asked question and debated topic is 'What is the speed of gravity?' It is only heard less often in the classroom because many teachers and most textbooks head off the question by hastily assuring students that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, leaving the firm impression, whether intended or not, that the question of gravityâ€™s propagation speed has already been answered.\n\nYet, anyone with a computer and orbit computation or numerical integration software can verify the consequences of introducing a delay into gravitational interactions ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
