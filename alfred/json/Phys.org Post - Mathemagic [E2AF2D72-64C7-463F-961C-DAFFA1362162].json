It is a common error, among admirers and critics alike, to assume that this is the case because the theory plays an important role, good or bad, in modern physics. The real reason why they merit attention is that they are early instances of 'mathemagics', namely the increasing reliance of modern physics on so-called counter-intuitive mathematical operations. The simple derivation is of particular importance, because its use of simple algebra allows insight into the grossly invalid symbolic usages which have become the norm in modern mathematical physics.\"",
