    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... According to Dolph Hooker:\n\n'It is also the concensus [sic] that, astonishingly and inexplicably, such conditions were comparatively uniform over most of the Earth's surface; that temperate climate extended both north and south to within the polar circles.  It is also believed that, amazingly, seasonal effects during most of geological time have been much less pronounced than they are now.' [72]\n\nWriting in 1912, F.H. Knowlton stated that:\n\n'Relative uniformity, mildness and comparative equability of climate, accompanied by high humidity, have prevailed over the greater part of the Earth, extending to or into polar circles, during the greater part of geologic time since at least the Middle Paleozoic.  This is the regular, the ordinary, the normal condition.' [73]\"\n\n(cont'd)",
