But in this field the adjustable parameters are endless and one never hears the crucial words: 'It just won't work, we have to go back and reconsider our fundamental assumptions.' The practical problem can be appreciated by glancing at any professional journal. One finds an enormous proliferation of articles dealing with minor aspects of models in which the science may be correct but the assumptions are often wrong ... I think the present state of the journals testifies to the fact that the point of no return has been passed.\"",
