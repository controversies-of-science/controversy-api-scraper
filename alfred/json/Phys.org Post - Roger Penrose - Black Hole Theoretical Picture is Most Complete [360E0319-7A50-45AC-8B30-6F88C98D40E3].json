    "snippet" : "\"Viewed from outside, no traces remain that distinguish how a particular hole formed, nor what kind of objects it swallowed. The great Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was deeply impressed by this realization, aesthetically as well as scientifically: 'In my entire scientific life, the most shattering experience has been the realization that an exact solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, discovered by the New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr, provides the absolutely exact representation of untold numbers of massive black holes that populate the Universe.' Roger Penrose, the theorist who perhaps did most to stimulate the renaissance in relativity theory that occurred in the 1960s, has remarked: 'It is ironic that the astrophysical object which is strangest and least familiar, the black hole, should be the one for which our theoretical picture is most complete.'\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.89-90",
