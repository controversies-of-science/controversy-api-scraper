Vast and exponentially-growing scientific enterprises have consumed vast resources without yielding any substantive progress at the level of in-your-face common sense evaluations; and the phenomenon continues for time-spans of whole generations, and there is no end in sight (short of the collapse of science-as-a-whole).\n\nAccording to the analysis of classical science, science was supposed to be uniquely self-correcting -- in practice, now, thanks in part to micro-specialization, it is not self-correcting at all -- except at the trivial and misleadingly reassuring level of micro-defined technical glitches and slip ups.\n\nEither what we call science nowadays is not 'real science' or else real science has mutated into something which is a mechanism for the perpetuation of error.\"",
