Moreover, the small size of particles retrieved from Eocene deep-sea sidements confirm the lack of wind speeds at that time. [47]\n\nContinental drift must also be ruled out because Axel Heiberg Island is 'only a few hundred kilometers closer to the North Pole than it was when the forests flourished' [48] -- which is definitely not enough for it to have been located outside the Arctic Circle at that time. As Johnson noted: 'Modern geological field work has confirmed that the northern lands of the globe have been located in polar latitudes for at least the last 100 million years, despite ongoing continental drift.'
