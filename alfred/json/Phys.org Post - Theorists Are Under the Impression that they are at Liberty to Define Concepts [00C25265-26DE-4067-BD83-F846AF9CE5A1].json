Larson, New Light on Space & Time)\n\n\"Present-day theorists are under the impression that they are at liberty to define the concepts, which they use in any way that they see fit. Herbert Dingle, for instance, tells us that atoms, as the physicist conceives them, are 'creatures of the imagination, to be formed into the image of our fancies and restricted by whatever laws we cared to prescribe, provided only that when they behaved in accordance with those laws they should produce phenomena.' Einstein's attitude toward basic concepts was similar. 'The axiomatic basis of theoretical physics ... must be free invention,' he insists. The weakness of this policy is that when conclusions are reached on the basis of such concepts, they too belong to the world of fancy, not to the world of reality.\"",
