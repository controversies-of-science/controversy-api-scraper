    "snippet" : "\"There are theories in science, which are so well verified by experience that they become promoted to the status of fact. One example is the Special Theory of Relativity -- it's still called a theory for historical reasons, but it is in reality a simple, engineering fact, routinely used in the design of giant machines, like nuclear particle accelerators, which always work perfectly. Another example of that sort of thing is the theory of evolution. These are called theories, but they are in reality among the best established facts in all of human knowledge.\"\n\n- Caltech Professor David L. Goodstein states in a video-tape lecture titled \"Atoms to Quarks\"",
