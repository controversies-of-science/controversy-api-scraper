So, in one hundred years, you cannot produce a theory of everything. This is crazy.  Even from a philosophical point of view, a historical point of view, we have begun a hundred years ago ... In 1920, we thought that the Milky Way was all the universe. And now, you want to produce the belief that in 80 years or something, you have produced the theory of all the universe, from the beginning to now.  This is not ... credible.\"\n\n(https:\/\/youtu.be\/IFFl9S39CTM?t=2847)",
