    "snippet" : "\"The real actors on the stage of the universe are very few, if their adventures are many. The most 'ancient treasure' -- in Aristotle's words -- that was left to us by our predecessors of the High and Far-off Times was the idea that the gods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside in the starry heavens, and all the stories, characters and adventures narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among the stars, who are planets. A prodigious assignment it may seem for those planets to account for all those stories and also to run the affairs of the whole universe.\"\n\n- Giorgio di Santillana and Hertha von Dechend, Hamlet's Mill",
