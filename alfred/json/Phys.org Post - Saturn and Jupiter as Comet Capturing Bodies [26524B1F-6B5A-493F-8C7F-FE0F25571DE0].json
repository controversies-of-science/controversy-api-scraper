    "snippet" : "Comyns Beaumont, The Mysterious Comet, 1932\n\n\"Astronomers allege that the two great outer planets, Saturn and Jupiter, attract comets into the solar system. Howe states that the attraction of Jupiter sometimes increases a comet's velocity and its orbit becomes a parabola, or, if it diminish it, an ellipse, when the comet becomes an attache of the sun. Many comets, he continues, mainly small, come from the direction of Jupiter, and that planet is said to have 'captured' them, whence they are labelled as members of the Jupiter family. (Study of the Sky, p.274) The same habit is said to apply to Saturn, believed by the ancients to be the main influence of comets, but Hale asserts that Jupiter draws in the greater number.\"",
