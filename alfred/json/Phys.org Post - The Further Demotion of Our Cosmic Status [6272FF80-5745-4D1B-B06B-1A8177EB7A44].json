    "snippet" : "\"We're reconciled to the post-Copernican idea that we don't occupy a central place in our universe. But now our cosmic status must seemingly be demoted still further. Particle chauvinism has to go: we're not made of the dominant stuff in the universe. We, the stars, and the visible galaxies are just traces of sediment -- almost a seeming afterthought -- in the cosmos; something quite different (and still unknown) controls its large-scale structure and eventual fate.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.75",
