Abbot, Home Secretary of the National Academy of Sciences in a letter to George Ellery Hale, founder and Director of Mount Wilson Observatory, Jan 20, 1920\n\n\"As to relativity, I must confess that I would rather have a subject in which there would be a half dozen members of the Academy competent enough to understand at least a few words of what the speakers were saying if we had a symposium upon it. I pray to God that the progress of science will send relativity to some region of space beyond the fourth dimension, from whence it may never return to plague us.\"",
