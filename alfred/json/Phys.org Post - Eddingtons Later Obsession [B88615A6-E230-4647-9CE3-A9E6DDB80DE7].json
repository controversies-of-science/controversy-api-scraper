    "snippet" : "\"Eddington, already celebrated for his classic and durable work on relativity and stellar structure, in later life became obsessed with a numerological 'fundamental theory', according to which our universe was closed and finite. He even proposed a formula for the exact number of atoms in the universe. In his 'Fundamental Theory,' Eddington wrote: 'I believe that there are 15,747,724,136,275,002,577,605,653,961,181,555,468,044,717,914,527, 116,709,366,231,425,076,185,631,031,296 protons in the Universe and the same number of electrons.' (This number is actually 2256 x 136.) No living scientist believes this, and hardly any have made the effort to fathom Eddington's reasoning.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.150",
