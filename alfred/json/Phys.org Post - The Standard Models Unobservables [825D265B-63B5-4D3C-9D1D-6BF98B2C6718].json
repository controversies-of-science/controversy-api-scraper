    "snippet" : "\"The problem with the medieval debate over how many angels could dance on the head of a pin was that angels were unobserved entities, and so could have any desired properties. Each of these classes of unobserved entities in the SM [standard model of particle physics] amounts to a fudge or patch applied to save a failing theory. So long as these fudged entities are made unobservable in principle, like the angel or the quark, they are safe from experimental falsification.\"\n\n- Don L. Hotson",
