    "snippet" : "Cosmic Plasma, Hannes Alfv√©n, 1981, p.36\n\n\"In the same way as two high power transmission cables connect a generator and a 'consumer', a pair of plasma cables may connect a generator and a 'consumer' ... The consumer may be a double layer accelerating charged particles which later produce light or synchrotron radiation. The consumer may also be a 'motor' which sets plasma in motion in a distant region. As an example, in the auroral circuit, the generator is located in the solar wind and the 'consumers' are double layers accelerating high energy particles which later illuminate the night sky in the auroral zone and\/or a 'motor' which produce the sun-ward drift in the magnetosphere. The observed existence of cable-like plasma configurations motivates us to draw electric circuit diagrams for electromagnetic phenomena in space, and to discuss them with the help of electrotechnical terminology.\"",
