    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Not long before my visit to Princeton, an eruption over a seemingly trivial affair had occurred among American astronomers. Immanuel Velikovsky published a book with the title Worlds in Collision in which he claimed that a sequence of dynamically impossible events had shaped society circa 3000 B.C., giving rise to well-known myths and legends. The book cared naught for science but a great deal for Velikovsky's reading of ancient documents, his expertise being in the deciphering of such papers. The book caused a sensation both with the public and among astronomers, the latter becoming stirred to near-violent displays of outrage. Such eminent figures as Harlow Shapley were heavily involved. It could be said that Shapley became angry even to the point of incoherence.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
