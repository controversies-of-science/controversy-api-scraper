    "snippet" : "Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., The Geometrisation of Physics, and its supposed Basis on the Michelson-Morley Experiment. Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.797\n\n\"The [Michelson-Morley] experiment therefore verifies the Fitzgerald contraction, and tends to confirm the electrical theory of matter. I was interested, when visiting the University of Chicago last winter, to find that Prof. Michelson himself was perfectly satisfied with this sort of view of his experiment, and did not consider its interpretation necessitated any revolutionary considerations. The Fitzgerald contraction is a peculiarity which could scarcely have been detected in any other way, since it is really an affair of the aether -- the connecting medium in which all molecules are embedded -- and affects every kind of matter to the same extent.\"",
