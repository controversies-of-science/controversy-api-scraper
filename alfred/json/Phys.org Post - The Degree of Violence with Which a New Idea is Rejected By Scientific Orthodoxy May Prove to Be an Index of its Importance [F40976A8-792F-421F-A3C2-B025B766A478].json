Bernard Cohen, professor of the history of science at Harvard, on April 24, 1952 symposium at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, as reported by John O'Neill, science editor for the New York Herald Tribune on May 4, 1952.  Stargazers & Gravediggers, p.249\n\n\"I do not know any scientist who was not antagonistic to, or who welcomed, a change that wholly replaced and rendered useless his own work.  It would thus be a perversion of the facts to say that all scientists welcome all changes ... There exists in science a general resistance to changes in fundamental concepts and theories and this constitutes a kind of scientific orthodoxy.  The degree of violence with which a new idea is rejected by scientific orthodoxy may prove to be an index of its importance.\"",
