Indeed, electrostatic solitary structures have been observed almost everywhere in the Earth’s environment. Most of the observations available, in the auroral terrestrial regions, in the Earth’s magnetotail as well as in the solar wind, have been rewiewed by Salem et al. [8]. The properties of these waves depend on the region of observation which determines the plasma regime.\n\nWIND observations have allowed for the determination of the rate of occurrence of WDL in the solar wind, N-sub-WDL ~ 1s⁻¹. We show that extrapolating this result leads to a total potential difference of 300 to 1000 Volts between the solar corona and 1 AU, which is in the range of values needed to maintain charge neutrality in the solar wind plasma [17] ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
