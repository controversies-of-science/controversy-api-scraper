After all, we don't know how to make either electron or positron. What is 'electric charge'? We haven't a clue. Why are their spins quantized in half-integer values? No idea. Where do they get their immense, anomalous angular momentum? Beats us. And how on earth do they manage to pack all this into a zero or near zero radius? Yet we baldly suppose that 'pure energy' knows how to do all these things we can't do!\"",
