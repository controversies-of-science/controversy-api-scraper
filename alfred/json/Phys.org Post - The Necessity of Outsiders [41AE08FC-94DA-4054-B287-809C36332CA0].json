    "snippet" : "Science: The Glorius Entertainment (1967)\nJacques Barzun on Specialization\n\n\"It is true that no outsider, not even the closest student of a science or art, will have the same familiarity with its difficulties as the practitioner. The outsider is often wrong and sometimes unjust; for lack of perfect fluency in the speech of the guild, he can sound ridiculous even when he is right. But none of this makes him any the less necessary. Science itself would never have made headway against the theological monopoly if the advocates of science had not gone 'out of their field' to criticize philosophy and religion as amateurs. It is the very familiarity with his own shop that prevents the professional from being critical of it or contemplative about it\"",
