    "snippet" : "Halton Arp, Seeing Red, p.273\n\n\"It would be ludicrous to imagine a da Vinci, van Gogh, Corot or Duchamps producing their work as a member of a University Art Department. Writers who move the culture say that the surest way to kill writing ability is to work in a Literature Department. Even seminal workers closer to science such as Galileo, Freud or Gropius would obviously stick in the throat of an academic institution.
