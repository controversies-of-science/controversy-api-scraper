    "snippet" : "\"More than fifty years ago, the great logician Kurt Gödel discovered that the theory of general relativity did not in itself preclude a time machine. He discovered a valid solution of Einstein's equations that described a bizarre universe where some of the worldlines were closed loops -- in other words, you could come back into your own past. But Gödel's solution was not realistic: it described a universe that was rotating and not expanding.\n\nOther theoretical examples of systems that seem to obey the laws of physics but which allow closed loops in time have been proposed. For example, Princeton theorist Richard Gott showed that a time machine could be constructed from two so-called cosmic strings -- long microscopically thin tubes of hyperdense material, heavy enough to distort space ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
