Exploration, Vol. 3, No. 2, p.103-112, 1989\n\n\"Shortly after the discovery of pulsars I wished to present an interpretation of what pulsars were, at this first pulsar conference -- namely that they were rotating neutron stars. The chief organizer of this conference said to me, 'Tommy, if I allow for that crazy an interpretation, there is no limit to what I would have to allow.' I was not allowed 5 minutes of floor time, although I in fact spoke from the floor. A few months later, this same organizer started a paper with the sentence, 'It is now generally considered that pulsars are rotating neutron stars.'\"",
