This eventuality was taken seriously enough by those in charge of the Brookhaven accelerator that they commissioned an expert assessment on whether experiments that crash together very heavy nuclei could trigger such a catastrophe. The experts offered reassurance. However, I don't think we can sleep completely soundly unless we are sure that essentially identical events have already happened naturally without any disaster ensuing. The acceptable level of risk in such an experiment is surely less than one chance in a trillion. Theoretical arguments alone cannot offer adequate comfort at this level: only a recklessly overconfident theorist would stake a bet on the validity of his assumptions at odds of a trillion to one.\"\n\n- Martin Rees, Our Cosmic Habitat (2001) p.120-121",
