    "snippet" : "\"... Using our planetary family as a model, says astronomer Gregory Laughlin of the University of California, Santa Cruz, 'has led to no success in extrapolating what's out there'.\n\nThe findings have triggered controversy and confusion, as astronomers struggle to work out what the old theory was missing. They are trying ideas, but are still far from sure how the pieces fit together. The field in its current state 'doesn't make much sense', says Norm Murray of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Toronto. 'It's impossible right now to account for everything,' agrees Kevin Schlaufman, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Until researchers reach a new consensus, they will not be able to understand how our own Solar System fits into the grand scheme of things, let alone predict what else might exist.\"",
