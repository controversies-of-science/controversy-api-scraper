    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... Beginning in 1978 high-resolution radio maps revealed that a radio galaxy's nucleus emits narrow beams of energy which connect them to outlying radio lobes. Then in 1980 a huge new radio telescope -- the Very Large Array (VLA), consisting of twenty-seven dish antennae spread over miles of New Mexico desert -- revealed to observers that the same jets emanate from the hearts of quasars.\n\nIt occurred to me that a plasma focus and a quasar are two processes, wildly different in scale, but identical in form and dynamics. Both consist of an extremely dense source of energy that emits diametrically opposed jets giving off high-frequency radiation. A plasma focus can increase the power density of its emissions by a factor of ten thousand trillion over that of the incoming energy -- comparable to the ratio of a quasar to a galaxy ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
