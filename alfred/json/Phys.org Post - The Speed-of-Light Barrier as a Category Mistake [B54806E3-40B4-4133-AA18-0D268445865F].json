    "snippet" : "\"The perennial aim of 'breaking the light-barrier' that Einsteinian relativity places on mechanical motion, conceived in a manner analogous to the sound-barrier, is a complete misconception. There is simply no such barrier -- except to progress in our modern understanding of nature. That whole idea of a 'light-barrier' is what philosophers call a 'category mistake', like thinking that 'putting the light out' is directly analogous to 'putting the cat out' or asking how much an amount of justice or courage weighs.\"\n\n- N.
