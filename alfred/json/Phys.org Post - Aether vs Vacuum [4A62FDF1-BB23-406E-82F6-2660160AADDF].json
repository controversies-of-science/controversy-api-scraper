    "snippet" : "\"Today the mechanical ether has been banished from the world of physics, and the word 'ether' itself, because of its 'bad' connotations, no longer occurs in textbooks on physics. We talk ostentatiously about the 'vacuum' instead, thereby indicating our lack of interest in the medium in which waves propagate. We no longer ask what it is that 'really oscillates' when we study electromagnetic waves or de Broglie  waves. All we wish to do is to formulate wave equations for these waves, through which we can predict experimentally observable phenomena ...\"\n\n- Prof. Eyvind H.
