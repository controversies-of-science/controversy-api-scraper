    "snippet" : "\"If a scientific theory is not mentioned by establishment figures, and the articles which propose it are not cited by them, the theory is automatically assessed as of low quality, even if no reason for disregarding it has been given. By contrast, if scientists go to great lengths to rebut an incorrect theory, that theory will be assessed as being of high quality, even if most observers regarded the theory as absurd from the outset.\"\n\n- John Hewitt, A Habit of Lies",
