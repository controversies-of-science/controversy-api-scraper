The device that is employed in relativity theory for interlocking closely time and distance measurements four-dimensional geometrical representation for all the events under contemplation. Each event is 'plotted,' so to speak, as a 'point' having four, instead of the usual three, coordinates; three of these fix the position in space of the event relative to some frame of reference, the fourth is a coordinate specifying the instant of occurrence of the event in the same frame of reference. \n\nMy own personal view of this procedure is that a geometrical manifold used for such a representation is a mathematical device that is very valuable for purposes of calculation, but I am not convinced that it is anything more than this. A convenient name for the four dimensional manifold is 'space-time,' but as for its 'reality' or its 'physical existence,' I would not like to commit myself because I do not know what these terms mean.\"",
