    "snippet" : "\"Popular journals such as Nature and Science are not in the business of science any more. They are in the business of making money. For this they need to make their readers happy. And since most readers have been conditioned in college to believe in mainstream theories that have been around for a century, the editors censure anything that departs from these expectations. The establishment has effectively worked its way to a catch-22 situation. Readers have been conditioned to take the fantastic conclusions of Mathematical Physics for science and the journals fear disappointing their customers.\"\n\n- Bill Gaede, youstupidrelativist.com",
