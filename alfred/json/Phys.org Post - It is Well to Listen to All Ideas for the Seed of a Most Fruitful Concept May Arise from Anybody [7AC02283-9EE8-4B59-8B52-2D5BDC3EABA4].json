    "snippet" : "\"It is well to listen to all ideas, for the seed of a most fruitful concept may arise from a seemingly insignificant member of the scientific community. The value of a scientist as he or she strives toward a better understanding of the physical and biological universe as created is determined solely through his or her ability to think, observe, interpret, and integrate concepts and ideas and formulate new theories and perform new experiments. Value is not determined by rank, salary, possessions, sex, race, religion, or place of birth, or pride. A good scientist wishes to serve mankind, stimulate creativity, help make life more abundant and full of joy, lift the physical burden and aid in the creation of a better understanding of the physical and biological worlds.\"\n\n- Dr. Robert J. Moon, International Journal of Fusion Energy, Vol. 3, No. 1, January 1985",
