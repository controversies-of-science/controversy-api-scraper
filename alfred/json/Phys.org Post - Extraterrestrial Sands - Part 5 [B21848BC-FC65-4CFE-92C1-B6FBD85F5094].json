The sands consist of 80 to 90 percent quartz with the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands orange and red. The question is: where did such immense amounts of sand come from? As with the Sahara, the source of the sand remains a matter of conjecture ...\n\nIt could not have been sourced locally as almost all the surrounding outcrops are carbonates. This has led some to search further afield ...\"\n\np53:\n\n\"As with all the world's sand deposits, what most people don't seem to consider here is the volume of granite rock required to produce so much quartz sand. Using the Rocky Mountains analogy above, we would require a granitic source five times the size of the Colorado Rockies just to produce the Navajo Sandstone deposit -- staggering volumes of source rock would have to be eroded.\"",
