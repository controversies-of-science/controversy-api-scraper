    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"Because the radial transport depends on the ionization potential of the element, elements with the lowest ionization potentials are brought closest to axis. The most abundant elements of cosmical plasma can be divided into groups of roughly equal ionization potentials: He(24 eV); H, 0, N(13 eV); C, S(11 eV); and Fe, Si, Mg(8 eV). These elements can be expected to form hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential. Helium will make up the most widely distributed outer layer; hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen should form the middle layers, while iron, silicon, and magnesium will make up the inner layers. Interlap between the layers can be expected and, for the case of galaxies, the metal–to–hydrogen ratio should be maximum near the center and decrease outwardly. Both the convection process and luminosity increase with the field Ez.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
