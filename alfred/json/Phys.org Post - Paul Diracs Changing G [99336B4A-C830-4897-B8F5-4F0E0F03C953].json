The theory is no longer taken seriously by either particle physicists or cosmologists. Paul Dirac had a continuing interest in such questions. Intrigued by coincidences between 'large numbers', he proposed an ingenious theory that accounted for cosmological as well as microscopic phenomena. The theory failed to catch on because one of its key predictions -- namely, that the gravitational constant G might change with time -- was never experimentally confirmed.\"",
