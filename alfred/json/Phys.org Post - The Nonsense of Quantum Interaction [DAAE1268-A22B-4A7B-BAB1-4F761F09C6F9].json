    "snippet" : "\"The quantum interaction between a pair of distance-separated atoms, as POAMS conceives it, is like a collision between two vehicles in accordance with Newton's law of direct and reciprocal action and reaction. To report this collision as an accident involving three vehicles, the two vehicles and the accident itself, is the sort of confusion modern physics creates by talking about quantum interactions between particles as if they were also 'particles' in the same sense. \n\nIn these and many other ways, POAMS seeks to purge modern physics of its historical proliferation of pure nonsense.\"\n\n- POAMS: A Revisionist Approach to Some Recalcitrant Problems in Modern Theoretical Physics, Editor Viv Pope, http:\/\/www.poams.org",
