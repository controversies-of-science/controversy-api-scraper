Kronos, Vol. IV No. 4, Summer 1979\n\n\"One can, of course, go on reducing the size of the anode (or, what amounts to the same thing electrically, increasing the current density in the discharge plasma). When this is done, however, the sheath at the anode must grow larger and larger, reaching farther and farther into the primary plasma in search of collectible electrons. This process is necessarily self-limiting, for as the sheath expands its electric field grows stronger and stronger. Electrons caught up in the field are accelerated to ever-greater energies. Before long, they become energetic enough to excite neutral particles they chance to collide with, and the sheath takes on a uniform glow -- the skin-like anode glow already referred to ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
