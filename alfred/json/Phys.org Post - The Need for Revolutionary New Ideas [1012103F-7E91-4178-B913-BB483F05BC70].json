We simply do not have a truly unified view of the world, one that paints an unambiguous picture of some overall scheme.\" (p.80)\n\n\"at some stage of horizontal unification, which proceeds by merging two branches of physics considered until then separate, one invariably confronts a deep fissure that can be overcome only with revolutionary new ideas.\" (p.81)",
