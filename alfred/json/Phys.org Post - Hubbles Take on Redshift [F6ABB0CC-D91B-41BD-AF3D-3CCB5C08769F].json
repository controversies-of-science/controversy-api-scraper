    "snippet" : "Allan Sandage, the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol. 83, No. 6, December 1989, \"Edwin Hubble 1889-1953\", p.6\n\n\"Hubble concluded that his observed log N(m) distribution showed a large departure from Euclidean geometry, provided that the effect of redshifts on the apparent magnitudes was calculated as if the redshifts were due to a real expansion. A different correction is required if no motion exists, the redshifts then being due to an unknown cause. Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession [i.e., no expansion]. To the very end of his writings he maintained this position, favoring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift 'represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature'.\"",
