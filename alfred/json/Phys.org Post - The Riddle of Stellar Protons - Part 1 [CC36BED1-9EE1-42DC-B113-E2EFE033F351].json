    "snippet" : "Harold Aspden, Our Physics World And Its Problems\n\n\"Given that the folklore of physics assures us that the sun, which comprises hydrogen, is powered by heat generated by nuclear fusion, one can hardly look ahead to the future feeling confident that what we might 'imagine' will solve our future energy problems, especially as doubts are being raised as to the very structure and composition of the hydrogen atom. I use the word 'folklore' because I have never seen an answer to the puzzle of how it is that some of the sun's hydrogen atoms can be ionized without their protons, then free and having a mass 1836 times that of the electron and so being subject to a very much stronger mutual gravitational interaction than applies between electrons, not thereby causing the sun to have a positively charged core ...\"\n\n(cont'd)",
