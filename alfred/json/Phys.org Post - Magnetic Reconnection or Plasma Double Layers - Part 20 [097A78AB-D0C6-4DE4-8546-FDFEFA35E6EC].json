    "snippet" : "(cont'd)\n\n\"... An electron moving through a magnetic field will experience a force - the Lorentz force - at right angles to it.  But that doesn't magnetize it.  When the electron leaves the magnetic field, it's left the magnetic field.  It doesn't 'de-magnetize'.\n\nSo this paper contains an even newer, never-seen-before quantity - magnetized electrons ... That's a new one.  We're being relentlessly confronted, it seems, by scientific papers written by investigators who want to impress funding agencies and the public with the cleverness of their imaginations free from the mundane restraints of real scientific knowledge - that is all of electromagnetic theory.\"",
