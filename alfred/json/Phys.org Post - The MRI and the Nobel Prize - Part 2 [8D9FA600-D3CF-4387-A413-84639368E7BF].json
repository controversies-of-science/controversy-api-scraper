Pollack\n(p.220)\n\n\"Within the considered paradigm, prime attention should be accorded elements that affect not only protein but also water structuring.  The story of cancer-cell water dates back several decades when a physician, Raymond Damadian, came to the laboratory of Gilbert Ling ... [who suggested in 1962 that cell water may differ from bulk water] ... for help.  Damadian had been wondering whether a difference of water structure might underlie organ pathologies, and began exploring the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance as a tool to test for such differences.  The collaboration proved fruitful.  Its evolution led to a breakthrough technology called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for which Damadian holds the patent.  This powerful technology arose directly out of the concept of structured cell water.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
