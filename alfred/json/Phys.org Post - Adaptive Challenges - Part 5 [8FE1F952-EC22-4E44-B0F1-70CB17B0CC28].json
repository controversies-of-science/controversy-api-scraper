    "snippet" : "The people who need to know this stuff the most tend to be the ones who refuse to learn it. The large bulk of the population at any moment is stuck in the first worldview they ever learned (the 3rd-order mindset). This is why paradigm change is so hard.\n\nNotice that as one matures, the rightmost column (what one is subject to) shifts to the column to the left of it (what can be seen as object). This is known as the subject-object relation.\n\nScience journalism encourages 3rd-order thinking insofar as there is no investigative aspect to it, no balanced coverage of scientific controversies (4th\/5th-order activities).\n\n5th-order thinkers are very rare in society, and are oftentimes shouted down by 3rd- and 4th-order people to the point that they decide against participating in these public conversations. Many CEO's exist at the 5th-order.\n\nThe people at the 3rd-order usually know nothing about any of this, because the subject-object relation precludes that understanding.",
