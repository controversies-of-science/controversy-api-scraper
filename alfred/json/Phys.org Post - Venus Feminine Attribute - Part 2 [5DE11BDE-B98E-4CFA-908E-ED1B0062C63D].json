Thus, in his recent book on Venus, Peter Cattermole noted that 'a female association is almost universal.' [2] And so it is, despite occasional statements to the contrary. [3]\"\n\n[2] P Cattermole, Venus: The Geological Story (Baltimore, 1994), p.1\n\n[3] Following the lead of Anthony Aveni, Grinspoon op. cit. p.24, writes that: \"It is simply not true that a female association is general.\" In support of this statement, Grinspoon points to Quetzalcoatl and Tlahuizcalpanteuctli as classic male Venus deities.  Here it can be shown that most of the male deities which various scholars have hitherto identified with Venus are actually Martian in origin.  See the discussion in E. Cochrane, \"Mars Gods of the New World,\" Aeon 4:1 (1995), pp.47-63.\n\n(cont'd)",
