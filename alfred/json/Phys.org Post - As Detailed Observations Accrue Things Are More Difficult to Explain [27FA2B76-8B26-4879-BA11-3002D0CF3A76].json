    "snippet" : "Sunspots: Theory and Observations, Ed. by John H Thomas & N O Weiss, NATO ASI Series C Vol 375, p.4\n\n\"... the problems of explaining the existence of an umbra and penumbra, and predicting the subphotospheric structure of a spot, seem ideally suited for theoretical study.  It is sobering that, after all these years, they have not been solved.  If we cannot explain such simple phenomena, how can we hope to model accretion discs or active galactic nuclei?  It seems, however, that unresolved objects can be relatively easy to explain: as detailed observations accrue they may actually make such problems harder.\"",
