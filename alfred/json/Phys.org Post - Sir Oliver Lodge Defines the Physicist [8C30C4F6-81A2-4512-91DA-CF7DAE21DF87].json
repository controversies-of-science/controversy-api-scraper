Nature, Feb 17, 1921, p.800\n\n\"... notwithstanding any temptation to idolatry, a physicist is bound in the long run to return to his right mind; he must cease to be influenced unduly by superficial appearances, impracticable measurements, geometrical devices, and weirdly ingenious modes of expression; and must remember that his real aim and object is absolute truth, however difficult of attainment that may be, that his function is to discover rather than to create, and that beneath and above and around all Appearances there exists a universe of full-bodied, concrete, absolute, Reality.\"",
