That's important to realize.\n\nAnother quote:\n\n'From previous satellites' measurements, we know that the magnetic fields act like a slingshot, sending the protons accelerating out. The decades-old mystery is what do the electrons do, and how do the two magnetic fields interconnect.' (Jim Burch, Principal investigator for MMS)\n\nMystery?  That mystery is self-imposed by astrophysicists who, intentionally perhaps, remain ignorant of Maxwell's Equations.  The two magnetic fields approaching each other form, at each instant, a new single magnetic field made up at every point within it of the vector sum of the two component fields.  That's all that happens when two magnetic fields come together.\n\nThey add up because empty space is a linear medium.  They add up as a vector sum of the component vectors of the two magnetic fields.\"\n\n(cont'd)",
