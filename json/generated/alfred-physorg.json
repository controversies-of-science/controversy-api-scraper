It seemed far more likely to me that the universe had always existed, its evolution accelerating over the aeons.\n\nI thought a great deal about problems that interested me in physics and cosmology, but I was busy earning a living. So it was not until 1981 that I actually began serious scientific research. The origin of that first project dated back to 1974, when I met Winston Bostick while we worked with a group advocating greater funds for controlled-fusion research.\n\nBostick's research centered on a fusion device called the plasma focus. It was the inspiration for my first astrophysical theories ...\""},{"id":"eric-lerner-on-plasma-focus-part-4","quoteName":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 4","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 4","quoteParagraph":"\"... The focus -- invented independently in the early sixties by a Soviet, N. V. Filippov, and an American, Joseph Mather -- is extremely simple, in contrast to the huge and complex tokamak, a large magnetic device that has long dominated fusion research. The focus consisted of two conducting copper cylinders, several centimeters across, nested inside each other (Fig. 6.12). When a large current is discharged across the cylinder, a remarkable sequence of events ensues.\n\nThe current rapidly ionizes the plasma and forms into eight or ten pairs of force-free filaments, each a millimeter in diameter, which roll down the cylinder, propelled by the interaction of their currents with the background magnetic field. When they reach the end of the cylinder, they fountain inward (Fig. 6.13a). Each pair, consisting of two vortices rotating in opposite direc- tions, annihilate each other, leaving only one survivor to carry the entire current ...\""},{"id":"eric-lerner-on-plasma-focus-part-5","quoteName":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 5","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 5","quoteParagraph":"\"... This survivor pinches itself off into a doughnut-shaped filamentary knot -- a plasmoid (Fig. 6.13b).\n\nThe plasmoid, only a half-millimeter across, now contains all the energy stored in the magnetic field of the entire device -- a million or more times bigger in volume. For a fraction of a micro-second, as the plasmoid continues to pinch itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because plasma tends to be opaque to low-frequency radiation and transparent to high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape.\n\nThis sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens. Since the electrons are traveling along magnetic-field lines, the weakening field tangles the electrons' path up as its shape changes -- causing the current to drop still further ...\""},{"id":"eric-lerner-on-plasma-focus-part-6","quoteName":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 6","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 6","quoteParagraph":"\"... The result is like turning off a switch, as in the double layers Alfven had observed. The falling magnetic field generates a huge electrical field, which shoots two high-energy beams out of the plasmoid -- the electrons in one direction, the ions in the other. The beams consist of extremely dense, helical filaments, each a micron (one ten-thousandth of a centimeter) across (Fig. 6.13c). In the course of this process some ions are heated to such high temperatures that they fuse.\n\nI was fascinated by the plasma focus for several reasons. For one thing, it was a promising approach to very economical fusion -- it doesn't need the huge magnets of the tokamak. But it also dramatically demonstrated plasma filaments' capacity to compress matter and energy. While at the time I wasn't aware of Alfven's extensive work, Bostick introduced me to his own ideas of how such filaments must have been relevant to galactic formation ...\""},{"id":"eric-lerner-on-plasma-focus-part-7","quoteName":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 7","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 7","quoteParagraph":"\"...

Their power density (power per cubic light-year) is a million trillion times larger than that of a galaxy.\n\nHow can such a small object generate so much energy?

A scientific revolution, such as the one that occurred with the arrival of quantum mechanics in 1925, sweeps away the pillars of scientific establishments. Within only two or three years, they are gone, to be replaced by a new generation of young people in their twenties. Today, in a state of zero progress -- indeed, with the stately galleon of science even blown backwards -- there is little hope for young people in their twenties. They must do what aging gurus tell them to do, which is nothing.\n\nA state of zero progress also favors demands on governments for larger and larger sums of money. Because, on the average, science has repaid society well over the years, scientists as a body hold a kind of blackmail over governments, blackmail that becomes stronger when things are going badly ...\""},{"id":"hoyle-explains-how-cosmology-stalls-out-part-4","quoteName":"Hoyle Explains How Cosmology Stalls Out - Part 4","keyword":"hoyle cosmology 4","quoteParagraph":"\"...

More and more extravagant expenditures on larger and larger machines and instruments are demanded in order to escape from the impasse, whereas, in good times, no such blackmail needs to be exercised. The worse things get, the more scientists meet together internationally in the interest (supposedly) of progress. But, as Tommy Gold points out, perpetually meeting together locks people's beliefs together into a fixed pattern, and, if the pattern is not yielding progress, the situation soon becomes moribund. These considerations provide ample motivation for attempts to preserve the status quo in cosmology: religion, the reputations of the aging, and money. Always in such situations in the past, however, the crack has eventually come.

This process is necessarily self-limiting, for as the sheath expands its electric field grows stronger and stronger. Electrons caught up in the field are accelerated to ever-greater energies.

Understanding collisionless plasma dynamics such as substorms in the plasma sheet requires the self-consistency that only kinetic theory can provide. Kinetic modeling is still undergoing continual development with many studies limited to one and two dimensions, but there is urgent need to improve these models as more and more data show kinetic physics is fundamentally important. Only then will we be able to make progress and obtain a correct picture of how collisionless plasmas work in space ...\n\nSerious objections have been raised from the beginning of the space era about the application of MHD theory to collisionless space plasmas ... Although it is well-known that MHD theory is applicable only to a restricted class of plasma problems of which collisionless plasmas are not a part (Krall and Trivelpiece, 1973), MHD and ideal MHD theories have been used in space without due regard to these restrictions.\""},{"id":"why-space-needs-to-go-beyond-the-mhd-box-part-3","quoteName":"Why Space Needs to Go Beyond the MHD Box - Part 3","keyword":"mhd box 3","quoteParagraph":"\"... Another issue in space physics is treating MHD fluids as ideal ... Ideal fluids have infinite conductivity (zero resistance) & the implicit charge mobility prevents them from supporting any E-field. The ideal fluid was originally conceptualized by Alfvén (1953) to study how MHD waves would behave if conductivity were imagined to be infinite. In such an ideal limit, magnetic fields would become frozen in the fluid. However, the frozen-in-field concept requires the strict criterion E · B = 0 which is not always satisfied in space ... This criterion is violated in Earth’s ionosphere where E|| has been observed ... in the vicinity of the magnetopause where it has been shown that the ion & electron motions are decoupled & thus the frozen-in-field condition is violated ... in the plasma sheet during substorms when large variations of the magnetic field are observed to generate new inductive currents ... and in the solar corona where the collisionless solar wind originates ...\""},{"id":"why-space-needs-to-go-beyond-the-mhd-box-part-4","quoteName":"Why Space Needs to Go Beyond the MHD Box - Part 4","keyword":"mhd box 4","quoteParagraph":"\"... Although electric fields in high conductivity plasmas are small, this small electric field is what enables plasmas to interact electromagnetically and produce currents and magnetic fields.
