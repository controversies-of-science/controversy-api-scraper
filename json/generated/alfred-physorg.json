When running a lab, I found that one of my most important activities was to go from room to room and discuss in depth the problems that a certain scientist or a group of scientists was trying to understand. It often happened that one group reported that in their field they had a special problem which they could not possibly understand. I told them that if they cared to open the door to the next room -- it was not locked! -- just this special problem had been solved half a year ago, and if they injected the solution into their own field, it would take a great leap forward. Often they were not at all happy for this suggestion ...\"\n\n\"...

The focus -- invented independently in the early sixties by a Soviet, N. V. Filippov, and an American, Joseph Mather -- is extremely simple, in contrast to the huge and complex tokamak, a large magnetic device that has long dominated fusion research. The focus consisted of two conducting copper cylinders, several centimeters across, nested inside each other (Fig. 6.12). When a large current is discharged across the cylinder, a remarkable sequence of events ensues.\n\nThe current rapidly ionizes the plasma and forms into eight or ten pairs of force-free filaments, each a millimeter in diameter, which roll down the cylinder, propelled by the interaction of their currents with the background magnetic field. When they reach the end of the cylinder, they fountain inward (Fig. 6.13a).

For a fraction of a micro-second, as the plasmoid continues to pinch itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because plasma tends to be opaque to low-frequency radiation and transparent to high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape.\n\nThis sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens. Since the electrons are traveling along magnetic-field lines, the weakening field tangles the electrons' path up as its shape changes -- causing the current to drop still further ...\""},{"recordType":"quote","sortBy":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 6","id":"eric-lerner-on-plasma-focus-part-6","quoteName":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 6","facetCategory":"Quotes","facetSubCategory":"plasma focus","quoteParagraph":"\"...

The beams consist of extremely dense, helical filaments, each a micron (one ten-thousandth of a centimeter) across (Fig. 6.13c). In the course of this process some ions are heated to such high temperatures that they fuse.\n\nI was fascinated by the plasma focus for several reasons. For one thing, it was a promising approach to very economical fusion -- it doesn't need the huge magnets of the tokamak. But it also dramatically demonstrated plasma filaments' capacity to compress matter and energy.

The problem here is that in certain areas as much as 400 coal seams have been found interspersed between other layers of sedimentation.

A science exists as a vast depository of facts and theories, from which must be chosen a few significant and central themes. To shape a subject in the mind requires more than technical knowledge: it demands that 'desire and pursuit of the whole' called natural philosophy.

This is mostly because the external world is bewilderingly complex. A mind incapable of imposing preconceived ideas onto what it observes will soon implode under the pressure of sensory overload. In the jargon of the philosophy of science, our perception of natural phenomena is ‘theory-laden’, and cannot be otherwise. The only alternative to the despotism of preconceived ideas is, in nearly all cases, an anarchic haze of disconnected thoughts and impressions. Theories also play an essential part in making linkages between seemingly disparate observations. Without a theoretical framework within which to make sense of them, many crucial facts seem isolated and unimportant.\""},{"recordType":"quote","sortBy":"Wolfram on Writing for Comprehension","id":"wolfram-on-writing-for-comprehension","quoteName":"Wolfram on Writing for Comprehension","facetCategory":"Quotes","facetSubCategory":"journalism","quoteParagraph":"Stephen Wolfram, A New Kind of Science, p.2\n\n\"There is a common style of understated scientific writing to which I was once a devoted subscriber.

The numbers were the final and only test, not only of truth but about meaning as well.
