So it was not until 1981 that I actually began serious scientific research. The origin of that first project dated back to 1974, when I met Winston Bostick while we worked with a group advocating greater funds for controlled-fusion research.\n\nBostick's research centered on a fusion device called the plasma focus. It was the inspiration for my first astrophysical theories ...\""},{"name":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 4","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 4","snippet":"\"... The focus -- invented independently in the early sixties by a Soviet, N. V. Filippov, and an American, Joseph Mather -- is extremely simple, in contrast to the huge and complex tokamak, a large magnetic device that has long dominated fusion research. The focus consisted of two conducting copper cylinders, several centimeters across, nested inside each other (Fig. 6.12). When a large current is discharged across the cylinder, a remarkable sequence of events ensues.\n\nThe current rapidly ionizes the plasma and forms into eight or ten pairs of force-free filaments, each a millimeter in diameter, which roll down the cylinder, propelled by the interaction of their currents with the background magnetic field. When they reach the end of the cylinder, they fountain inward (Fig. 6.13a). Each pair, consisting of two vortices rotating in opposite direc- tions, annihilate each other, leaving only one survivor to carry the entire current ...\""},{"name":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 5","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 5","snippet":"\"...

For a fraction of a micro-second, as the plasmoid continues to pinch itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because plasma tends to be opaque to low-frequency radiation and transparent to high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape.\n\nThis sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens. Since the electrons are traveling along magnetic-field lines, the weakening field tangles the electrons' path up as its shape changes -- causing the current to drop still further ...\""},{"name":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 6","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 6","snippet":"\"...

The beams consist of extremely dense, helical filaments, each a micron (one ten-thousandth of a centimeter) across (Fig. 6.13c). In the course of this process some ions are heated to such high temperatures that they fuse.\n\nI was fascinated by the plasma focus for several reasons. For one thing, it was a promising approach to very economical fusion -- it doesn't need the huge magnets of the tokamak. But it also dramatically demonstrated plasma filaments' capacity to compress matter and energy. While at the time I wasn't aware of Alfven's extensive work, Bostick introduced me to his own ideas of how such filaments must have been relevant to galactic formation ...\""},{"name":"Eric Lerner on Plasma Focus - Part 7","keyword":"lerner plasma focus 7","snippet":"\"...

Their power density (power per cubic light-year) is a million trillion times larger than that of a galaxy.\n\nHow can such a small object generate so much energy?

Both consist of an extremely dense source of energy that emits diametrically opposed jets giving off high-frequency radiation.
