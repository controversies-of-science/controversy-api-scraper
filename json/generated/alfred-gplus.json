Set against a backdrop of bright gas, the black hole's massive gravitational pull bends light into a ring. However, this isn't a real photograph, but a computer graphic rendering — an artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>0:31</p>\n\n<p><em>\"A hundred years ago, Albert Einstein first published his theory of general relativity. In the years since then, scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it. But one thing predicted from this theory, black holes, still have not been directly observed. Although we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like, we've never actually taken a picture of one before. However, you might be surprised to know that that may soon change. We may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years. Getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists, an Earth-sized telescope and an algorithm that puts together the final picture. Although I won't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today, I'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved in getting that first picture.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>1:18</p>\n\n<p>_\"My name is Katie Bouman, and I'm a PhD student at MIT. <em>I do research in a computer science lab that works on making computers see through images and video.</em> But although I'm not an astronomer, today I'd like to show you how I've been able to contribute to this exciting project.\"_</p>\n\n<p>1:34</p>\n\n<p><em>\"If you go out past the bright city lights tonight, you may just be lucky enough to see a stunning view of the Milky Way Galaxy. And if you could zoom past millions of stars, 26,000 light-years toward the heart of the spiraling Milky Way, we'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center. Peering past all the galactic dust with infrared telescopes, astronomers have watched these stars for over 16 years. But it's what they don't see that is the most spectacular. These stars seem to orbit an invisible object. By tracking the paths of these stars, astronomers have concluded that the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion is a supermassive black hole — an object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close — even light.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>2:19</p>\n\n<p>_\"But what happens if we were to zoom in even further? <em>Is it possible to see something that, by definition, is impossible to see? Well, it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths, we'd expect to see a ring of light caused by the gravitational lensing of hot plasma zipping around the black hole. In other words, the black hole casts a shadow on this backdrop of bright material, carving out a sphere of darkness. This bright ring reveals the black hole's event horizon, where the gravitational pull becomes so great that not even light can escape.</em> Einstein's equations predict the size and shape of this ring, so taking a picture of it wouldn't only be really cool, it would also help to verify that these equations hold in the extreme conditions around the black hole.\"_</p>\n\n<p>3:01</p>\n\n<p>_\"<em>However, this black hole is so far away from us, that from Earth, this ring appears incredibly small — the same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon.</em> That makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult. Why is that? Well, it all comes down to a simple equation. Due to a phenomenon called diffraction, there are fundamental limits to the smallest objects that we can possibly see. This governing equation says that in order to see smaller and smaller, we need to make our telescope bigger and bigger. <em>But even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on Earth, we can't even get close to the resolution necessary to image on the surface of the moon.</em> In fact, here I show one of the highest resolution images ever taken of the moon from Earth. It contains roughly 13,000 pixels, and yet each pixel would contain over 1.5 million oranges.\"_</p>\n\n<p>3:54</p>\n\n<p><em>\"So how big of a telescope do we need in order to see an orange on the surface of the moon and, by extension, our black hole? Well, it turns out that by crunching the numbers, you can easily calculate that we would need a telescope the size of the entire Earth.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>4:07</p>\n\n<p>(Laughter)</p>\n\n<p>4:08</p>\n\n<p>_\"If we could build this Earth-sized telescope, we could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light indicative of the black hole's event horizon. <em>Although this picture wouldn't contain all the detail we see in computer graphic renderings</em>, it would allow us to safely get our first glimpse of the immediate environment around a black hole.\"_</p>\n\n<p>4:25</p>\n\n<p><em>\"However, as you can imagine, building a single-dish telescope the size of the Earth is impossible. But in the famous words of Mick Jagger, 'You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get what you need.' And by connecting telescopes from around the world, an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope is creating a computational telescope the size of the Earth, capable of resolving structure on the scale of a black hole's event horizon. This network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture of a black hole next year. Each telescope in the worldwide network works together. Linked through the precise timing of atomic clocks, teams of researchers at each of the sights freeze light by collecting thousands of terabytes of data. This data is then processed in a lab right here in Massachusetts.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>5:12</p>\n\n<p>_\"So how does this even work? Remember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy, we need to build this impossibly large Earth-sized telescope? For just a second, let's pretend we could build a telescope the size of the Earth. This would be a little bit like turning the Earth into a giant spinning disco ball. Each individual mirror would collect light that we could then combine together to make a picture. <em>However, now let's say we remove most of those mirrors so only a few remained. We could still try to combine this information together, but now there are a lot of holes. These remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes. This is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from. But although we only collect light at a few telescope locations, as the Earth rotates, we get to see other new measurements. In other words, as the disco ball spins, those mirrors change locations and we get to observe different parts of the image. The imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball in order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image. If we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe — in other words, the entire disco ball — this would be trivial. However, we only see a few samples, and for that reason, there are an infinite number of possible images that are perfectly consistent with our telescope measurements. However, not all images are created equal. Some of those images look more like what we think of as images than others. And so, my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole is to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image that also fits the telescope measurements.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>6:45</p>\n\n<p>_\"Just as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions to piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure, the imaging algorithms I develop use our limited telescope data to guide us to a picture that also looks like stuff in our universe. Using these algorithms, we're able to piece together pictures from this sparse, noisy data. So here I show a sample reconstruction done using simulated data, when we pretend to point our telescopes to the black hole in the center of our galaxy. Although this is just a simulation, reconstruction such as this give us hope that we'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole and from it, determine the size of its ring. <em>Although I'd love to go on about all the details of this algorithm, luckily for you, I don't have the time.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>7:32</p>\n\n<p>_\"But I'd still like to give you a brief idea of how we define what our universe looks like, and how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results. <em>Since there are an infinite number of possible images that perfectly explain our telescope measurements, we have to choose between them in some way. We do this by ranking the images based upon how likely they are to be the black hole image, and then choosing the one that's most likely.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>7:56</p>\n\n<p><em>\"So what do I mean by this exactly? Let's say we were trying to make a model that told us how likely an image were to appear on Facebook. We'd probably want the model to say it's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left, and pretty likely that someone would post a selfie like this one on the right. The image in the middle is blurry, so even though it's more likely we'd see it on Facebook compared to the noise image, it's probably less likely we'd see it compared to the selfie.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>8:21</p>\n\n<p>_<em>\"But when it comes to images from the black hole, we're posed with a real conundrum: we've never seen a black hole before. In that case, what is a likely black hole image, and what should we assume about the structure of black holes? We could try to use images from simulations we've done, like the image of the black hole from 'Interstellar,' but if we did this, it could cause some serious problems. What would happen if Einstein's theories didn't hold? We'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on. If we bake Einstein's equations too much into our algorithms, we'll just end up seeing what we expect to see. In other words, we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>8:59</p>\n\n<p>(Laughter)</p>\n\n<p>9:01</p>\n\n<p>_\"Different types of images have very distinct features. We can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images and images we take every day here on Earth. <em>We need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like without imposing one type of image's features too much. One way we can try to get around this is by imposing the features of different kinds of images and seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions. If all images' types produce a very similar-looking image, then we can start to become more confident that the image assumptions we're making are not biasing this picture that much.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>9:36</p>\n\n<p><em>\"This is a little bit like giving the same description to three different sketch artists from all around the world. If they all produce a very similar-looking face, then we can start to become confident that they're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings. One way we can try to impose different image features is by using pieces of existing images. So we take a large collection of images, and we break them down into their little image patches. We then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle. And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image that also fits our telescope measurements.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>10:14</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Different types of images have very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces. So what happens when we take the same data but we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image? Let's first start with black hole image simulation puzzle pieces. OK, this looks reasonable. This looks like what we expect a black hole to look like. But did we just get it because we just fed it little pieces of black hole simulation images? Let's try another set of puzzle pieces from astronomical, non-black hole objects. OK, we get a similar-looking image. And then how about pieces from everyday images, like the images you take with your own personal camera? Great, we see the same image. When we get the same image from all different sets of puzzle pieces, then we can start to become more confident that the image assumptions we're making aren't biasing the final image we get too much.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>11:04</p>\n\n<p>_\"Another thing we can do is take the same set of puzzle pieces, such as the ones derived from everyday images, and use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images. So in our simulations, we pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non-black hole objects, as well as everyday images like the elephant in the center of our galaxy. <em>When the results of our algorithms on the bottom look very similar to the simulation's truth image on top, then we can start to become more confident in our algorithms.</em> And I really want to emphasize here that all of these pictures were created by piecing together little pieces of everyday photographs, like you'd take with your own personal camera. So an image of a black hole we've never seen before may eventually be created by piecing together pictures we see all the time of people, buildings, trees, cats and dogs. Imaging ideas like this will make it possible for us to take our very first pictures of a black hole, <em>and hopefully, verify those famous theories on which scientists rely on a daily basis.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>12:01</p>\n\n<p>_\"But of course, getting imaging ideas like this working would never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers that I have the privilege to work with. It still amazes me that although <em>I began this project with no background in astrophysics</em>, what we have achieved through this unique collaboration could result in the very first images of a black hole. But big projects like the Event Horizon Telescope are successful due to all the interdisciplinary expertise different people bring to the table. We're a melting pot of astronomers, physicists, mathematicians and engineers. This is what will make it soon possible to achieve something once thought impossible.\"_</p>\n\n<p>12:35</p>\n\n<p><em>\"I'd like to encourage all of you to go out and help push the boundaries of

Physics itself interested me, learning why things happen as they do -- mathematics was merely a tool to understand and test the underlying physical concepts. That was not the way physics was taught; instead, mathematical techniques were emphasized. This is almost exclusively what students are still tested on, and obviously what they study the most.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I went on to graduate work in physics at the University of Maryland, intending to get a doctorate. But after a year, I left. I couldn't reconcile myself with the mathematical approach, which seemed sterile and abstract -- especially in particle physics, in which I had considered specializing.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>After leaving school in 1970 I began to work as a science writer -- first for Collier's Encyclopedia and then freelance, writing technical reports and magazine articles. This kept me in touch with the latest developments in astrophysics, controlled fusion, and particle physics, among other things; my work was an opportunity to complete my education in physics. I especially learned about plasma physics, which had not been touched on at Columbia or Maryland.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The seventies were the heyday of the Big Bang cosmology, but I was skeptical of it and the associated developments in high-energy physics. I knew from my Columbia days that there were fundamental contradictions in particle theory which had been swept under the rug (see Chapter Eight). The Big Bang's universe, wound up in the beginning and steadily running down, seemed wildly unscientific, and I knew that its theorists had never resolved the fundamental problem of the initial source of energy. It seemed far more likely to me that the universe had always existed, its evolution accelerating over the aeons.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I thought a great deal about problems that interested me in physics and cosmology, but I was busy earning a living. So it was not until 1981 that I actually began serious scientific research. The origin of that first project dated back to 1974, when I met Winston Bostick while we worked with a group advocating greater funds for controlled-fusion research.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Bostick's research centered on a fusion device called the plasma focus. It was the inspiration for my first astrophysical theories. The focus -- invented independently in the early sixties by a Soviet, N. V. Filippov, and an American, Joseph Mather -- is extremely simple, in contrast to the huge and complex tokamak, a large magnetic device that has long dominated fusion research. The focus consisted of two conducting copper cylinders, several centimeters across, nested inside each other (Fig. 6.12). When a large current is discharged across the cylinder, a remarkable sequence of events ensues.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The current rapidly ionizes the plasma and forms into eight or ten pairs of force-free filaments, each a millimeter in diameter, which roll down the cylinder, propelled by the interaction of their currents with the background magnetic field. When they reach the end of the cylinder, they fountain inward (Fig. 6.13a). Each pair, consisting of two vortices rotating in opposite direc- tions, annihilate each other, leaving only one survivor to carry the entire current. This survivor pinches itself off into a doughnut-shaped filamentary knot -- a plasmoid (Fig. 6.13b).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The plasmoid, only a half-millimeter across, now contains all the energy stored in the magnetic field of the entire device -- a million or more times bigger in volume. For a fraction of a micro-second, as the plasmoid continues to pinch itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because plasma tends to be opaque to low-frequency radiation and transparent to high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens. Since the electrons are traveling along magnetic-field lines, the weakening field tangles the electrons' path up as its shape changes -- causing the current to drop still further.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The result is like turning off a switch, as in the double layers Alfven had observed. The falling magnetic field generates a huge electrical field, which shoots two high-energy beams out of the plasmoid -- the electrons in one direction, the ions in the other. The beams consist of extremely dense, helical filaments, each a micron (one ten-thousandth of a centimeter) across (Fig. 6.13c). In the course of this process some ions are heated to such high temperatures that they fuse.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I was fascinated by the plasma focus for several reasons. For one thing, it was a promising approach to very economical fusion -- it doesn't need the huge magnets of the tokamak. But it also dramatically demonstrated plasma filaments' capacity to compress matter and energy. While at the time I wasn't aware of Alfven's extensive work, Bostick introduced me to his own ideas of how such filaments must have been relevant to galactic formation.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A few years later, I began to think that the plasma focus provides a model for another cosmic phenomenon -- quasars. Over hundreds of thousands of years quasars radiate ten thousand times more energy than an average galaxy of a hundred billion stars, yet appear to be no more than a light-year or so across, compared with a galaxy's hundred thousand light-years. Their power density (power per cubic light-year) is a million trillion times larger than that of a galaxy.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>How can such a small object generate so much energy? Conventional wisdom claims that a black hole is at work, but, among other objections, there are cogent reasons to think that any object massive enough to power a quasar will break apart before it collapses into a black hole. In any case, new observations had raised another mystery.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Beginning in 1978 high-resolution radio maps revealed that a radio galaxy's nucleus emits narrow beams of energy which connect them to outlying radio lobes. Then in 1980 a huge new radio telescope -- the Very Large Array (VLA), consisting of twenty-seven dish antennae spread over miles of New Mexico desert -- revealed to observers that the same jets emanate from the hearts of quasars.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It occurred to me that a plasma focus and a quasar are two processes, wildly different in scale, but identical in form and dynamics. Both consist of an extremely dense source of energy that emits diametrically opposed jets giving off high-frequency radiation. A plasma focus can increase the power density of its emissions by a factor of ten thousand trillion over that of the incoming energy -- comparable to the ratio of a quasar to a galaxy.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>But how can a galaxy generate an electrical current? I knew about disk generators and calculated that a galaxy rotating in a magnetic field will generate a current flowing toward its center sufficient to power vast plasmoids -- a process Alfven had proposed four years earlier, I later found out. Since the currents must flow out along the axis, they will arc around, as in the plasma focus -- a similar geometry leads to plasmoid formation in both cases.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>While these ideas were crystallizing I was also studying the evidence, accumulating since 1978, for the existence of filament-like superclusters of galaxies. I had seen Peebles's 'Cosmic Tapestry' poster, showing the galaxies strung along lacy threads. Why couldn't these filaments of galaxies be larger versions of the filaments in the plasma focus and the filaments that I hypothesized to form in galaxies? They would produce magnetic fields in which galaxies, as they rotate, would produce the plasmoids that make up quasars or active galactic nuclei.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"europas-cracks","quoteName":"Europa's Cracks","keyword":"europa","quoteParagraph":"<p><a href=\"https://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050314europadynamics.htm\">https://www.thunderbolts.info/tpod/2005/arch05/050314europadynamics.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Mar 14, 2005\nEuropa--Dynamics of Rille Formation</p>\n\n<p>High-resolution photographs of Europa’s surface show that the web of grooves and channels cannot be the surface “fractures” that planetary scientists have long claimed.</p>\n\n<p>When the first close-up photographs of Jupiter’s moon Europa were returned to earth from Voyager 2, scientists were surprised to find that water ice covered the surface. They were also surprised by the absence of visible craters, since Jupiter is considered the “vacuum cleaner” of the solar system and should have pulled many meteoroids and occasional asteroids into collision courses with it. Unknown events in geologically recent times have resurfaced the Jovian moon from pole to pole.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of craters, what planetary scientists saw was a global network of linear impressions or channels. They immediately began to speculate about a vast complex of “fractures” on the moon. They surmised that, from beneath the surface, dark material had filled the cracks or oozed out onto the surface as levees running along the two sides of the trenches. This would account for the dark coloration of the markings.</p>\n\n<p>This initial interpretation stuck—for what else could these strange surface impressions be? “Cracking” of Europa’s surface remained the official interpretation even as, beginning in 1996, higher resolution images returned by the Galileo probe undermined the entire idea that the channels were cracks. Many of the larger channels are smoothly cut, and they do not look like fractures. The force creating them disregarded the presence of prior channels and often produced a constant channel width for up to a thousand kilometers or more.</p>\n\n<p>From an electrical viewpoint this is not surprising. The current  of an electric discharge,  flowing  across the surface, has an associated magnetic field which “pinches” it into a thin filament and tends to draw concurrent filaments into parallel alignment.</p>\n\n<p>The standard interpretation only grew more implausible as Galileo began to send back even closer views of the surface: As resolution increased, the cameras simply revealed more channels, in the same way fractal geometry replicates similar patterns at different scales. This is also a well-known characteristic of plasma discharge phenomena.</p>\n\n<p>To be sure, there are chaotic regions on Europa that show massive fracturing and rafting of ice sheets, and it is evident that the events that shattered extensive layers of ice also caused breaks and movement along some pre-existing channels. But channels with no evidence of fracturing are far more abundant. And virtually all regions of Europa—even the displaced ice sheets—reveal complexes of parallel and side-by-side grooves with levees and no indications of fracturing. Can ice be repeatedly broken in ways that produce extensive parallel grooves with levees? The claim finds no support in nature or in controlled experiment.  The levees required an additional ad hoc requirement that the cracks repeatedly opened and closed to force material over the sides.</p>\n\n<p>There is a model, however, that can account for the appearance of Europa at all scales of observation.</p>\n\n<p>The picture on the right is the closest image of Europa’s surface, taken at an oblique angle as the Galileo spacecraft flew 200 kilometers above the surface on December 16, 1997. It provided a view similar to that from an aircraft window. The colossal scale of the ridges gives the impression of flying much lower, and the perspective allows us to see the nature of the channels. They are not cracks in the ice. They are overlying and intersecting V-shaped troughs, The dark coloration down their centers appears in many places to be comprised of a string of small craters with dark material in their centers.</p>\n\n<p>The V-shaped configuration is consistent with a powerful underground explosion, which creates a conical vent.  A narrow discharge channel moving explosively beneath the surface will throw material above it onto the two sides of a V-cross-section trench. In the electrical interpretation, the narrow lines of dark material at the base of the channel mark out the material directly acted on by the discharge—smashing oxygen atoms, two by two, into atoms of sulfur. The lighter material was the ice above the discharge channel, blown to the two sides of the channel</p>\n\n<p>A close inspection of such regions, we believe, will verify that that the primary features on Europa are rilles, with many analogs on other planets and moons. Moreover, if the electrical theorists are correct, traditional geologic models based on slow processes occurring on earth will invariably fail.  They claim that electric discharge repeatedly raked across the surface of this Jovian moon.</p>"},{"id":"gravity-at-large-scales","quoteName":"Gravity at Large Scales","keyword":"gravity interstellar intergalactic","quoteParagraph":"<p>Quote from <em>Bankrupting Physics: How Today's Top Scientists Are Gambling Away Their Credibility</em>, by Alexander Unzicker and Sheilla Jones (2013), p10:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Combing through the library, I found a well-known textbook on galactic dynamics where the authors state:</em></p>\n\n<p>_'It is worth remembering that all of the discussion so far has been based on the premise that Newtonian gravity and general relativity are correct on large scales. <em>In fact, there is little or no direct evidence that conventional theories of gravity are correct on scales much larger than a light year or so.</em> Newtonian gravity works extremely well on scales of 10^12 meters, the solar system (...) <em>It is principally the elegance of general relativity and its success in solar system tests that lead us to the bold extrapolation to scales 10^19 - 10^24 meters</em> ...

On the contrary, it is a question which we have to be very well aware of.

And it soon became clear that the first extraordinary thing about the evidence for the Hockey Stick was how extraordinarily weak it was, and the second extraordinary thing was how desperate its defenders were to hide this fact. The Hockey Stick is obviously wrong. Climategate 2011 shows that even many of its most outspoken public defenders know it is obviously wrong. And yet it goes on being published and defended year after year. Do I expect you to publicly denounce the Hockey Stick as obvious drivel? Well yes, that’s what you should do. It is the job of scientists of integrity to expose pathological science. It is a litmus test of whether climate scientists are prepared to stand up against the bullying defenders of pathology in their midst.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Two of the most surprising statements (to me) are from two young scientists associated with Skeptical Science:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Neal King: My impression is that Mann and buddies have sometimes gone out on a limb when that was unnecessary and ill-advised. Mann, for all his technical ability, is sometimes his own worst enemy. Similarly, with regard to “hiding the decline” in Climategate, I am left with the impression that the real question is, Why would you believe the tree-ring proxies at earlier times when you KNOW that they didn’t work properly in the 1990s? Mann et al spent too much time defending what was incorrect, and allowed the totality of the argument to become “infected” by the fight.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Robert Way: I don’t mean to be the pessimist of the group here but Mc2 brought up some very good points about the original hockey stick. I’ve personally seen work that is unpublished that challenges every single one of his reconstructions because they all either understate or overstate low-frequency variations. Mann et al stood by after their original HS and let others treat it with the confidence that they themselves couldn’t assign to it. The original hockey stick still used the wrong methods and these methods were defended over and over despite being wrong. He fought like a dog to discredit and argue with those on the other side that his method was not flawed. And in the end he never admitted that the entire method was a mistake. They then let this HS be used in every way possible despite knowing the stats behind it weren’t rock solid.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This selection of quotes does not include the strongest ‘zingers’, which come from scientists that are somewhat further afield or have made public statements that are critical of the AGW consensus.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"monitor-article-on-hot-venus","quoteName":"Monitor Article on Hot Venus","keyword":"venus pioneer monitor","quoteParagraph":"<p>\"The mystery of Venus' internal heat\", Nov. 13 1980 issue of <em>New Scientist</em></p>\n\n<p>_<em>\"Two years' surveillance by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter seems to show that Venus is radiating away more energy than it receives from the Sun.</em>  If this surprising result is confirmed, it means that the planet itself is producing far more heat than the Earth does._</p>\n\n<p><em>F.W.

What should be explained is methods of science, but what most people concerned with the issues want the public to know about is the truth about the natural world -- that is, what the powerful believe to be the truth about the natural world. The laudable reason for concern with public understanding is that scientific and technological issues figure more and more in the political process. Citizens, when they vote, need to know enough to come to some decision about whether they prefer more coal mines or more nuclear power stations, more corn or clearer rivers, more tortured animals or more healthy children, or whether these really are the choices. Perhaps there are novel solutions: wave power, organic farming, drug testing without torture.

Why? -- because PhDs and professors are found on all sides in these debates. The arguments have largely been invented in universities. Thus, all sides have expertise way beyond what can ever be hoped of the person in the street, and all sides know how to argue their case clearly and without obvious fallacies. Why such debates are unresolvable, in spite of all this expertise, is what we have tried to show in the descriptive chapters of this book.

The authors believe that they understand the vertical dependence of the flux errors, and by adjusting the fluxes to reasonable values at low altitudes, they have derived corrected thermal fluxes</em> as shown in Fig. 5 (Revercomb et al. 1980).\"_</p>\n\n<p>From Charles Ginenthal's Newton, Einstein &amp; Velikovsky: Celestial Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Solar System Instability &amp; Cosmology, excerpts from p225 - 235:</p>\n\n<p>_\"Taken together, the top of Venus' atmosphere exhibits a thermal imbalance of 15 to 20%, the middle and lower atmosphere, a thermal imbalance of around 50%, while <em>the surface, on average, the thermal imbalance was 40 times greater than sunlight could provide</em> ... <em>The tremendous rise in infrared radiation, as one nears the surface of Venus, is similar to the heat emitted, say, by a white-hot block of metal, in that as one puts one's hand closer and closer to it, the heat rises to greater and greater levels, but at a certain point close to it, the heat rises immensely.\"</em>_ (p228)</p>\n\n<p>_\"Taylor, et al., assumed what they had not proved was responsible for heating Venus's atmosphere at the cloud tops, and to escape their assumption, called this 'the most [probable] value.' <em>They made that choice not based on scientific evidence, but on an assumption set ... up as a kind of psychological reality and admitted it was their 'most [probable] value.' This, then, became the mantra upon which all the other readings were to be hammered into place.\"</em>_ (p226)</p>\n\n<p>Astronomers cite Tomasko's article on pages 611 - 612 of the definitive book on Venus, <em>Venus</em>, by Hunten, Colin, Donahue, Moroz, publ. Univ. of Arizona Press, 1983). This is a monstrous size and costs $80: difficult for ordinary people to gain access. Strangely, there are two articles about thermal equilibrium, the Tomasko article on pages 611-612, AND an article by F.W. Taylor on page 658. It turns out that only by adopting the most myopic view possible can you get thermal equilibrium from the evidence, and that is what Tomasko does.</p>\n\n<p>For thermal equilibrium to pertain, two numbers must match up; the first is emissions which all parties involved agree reads correctly as 0.76. The second number is the planetary albedo. Tomasko claims (pp 611-612) \"For the whole planet to be in equilibrium with absorbed sunlight, the bolometric albedo would have to be 0.76. The second number is the planetary albedo. Tomasko claims (pp 611-612) \"For the whole planet to be in equilibrium with absorbed sunlight, the bolometric albedo would have to be 0.76...\" But the Pioneer Venus readings on albedo (Taylor's article, page 658) was 0.80 plus/minus 0.02, and the calculations from Venera data (also page 658) are 0.79, plus 0.02, minus 0.01. The closest you could get and stay within error bounds is 0.78.</p>\n\n<p>Now you might ask, what's a lousy 0.02 amongst friends; doesn't sound like much ... This is one of those cases in which a little bit appears to go a long way. Consider what Taylor claims would have to be believed if the 0.80 figure for albedo were to hold good (also page 658): 'Clearly, the Pioneer measurements of emission and reflection are not consistent with each other if radiative balance applies.</p>\n\n<p>Taylor does not particularly want to believe what the data is telling him: that there is no way that Venus is within error bounds of thermal equilibrium, but he does not deny the data. How then does Tomasko make a claim of equilibrium? Tomasko cites one 1968 calculation of albedo of 0.77 +- 0.07 without bothering to tell you that that estimate was later revised upwards to 0.80 +- 0.07 in 1975 (Taylor tells us that on page 657), and notes that Taylor's indication of 0.02 error bounds for the Pioneer reading (the most recent, and done with the best instruments from the best distance) may be 'too small'.</p>\n\n<p>Taylor notes (page 758): 'A more acceptable alternative is that the preliminary estimate of 0.80 +- .02 for the albedo from the PV measurements is too high, since the uncertainty limit is now known from further work to be too conservative (J. V. Martinchik, personal communication). A fuller analysis of PV albedo data - still the best in terms of wave length, spatial and phase coverage, and radiometric precision, which is likely to be obtained for the forseeable future, is likely to resolve this puzzle. In conclusion then, the best thermal measurements of Venus, with the assumption of global energy balance, yield a value of the albedo of 0.76 +- .01; this is the most probable value.'</p>\n\n<p>Tomasko is basing his entire case on one outdated calculation, and upon a 'personal communication from Martinchik'.</p>\n\n<p>Taylor is saying that the best measurements available tell us that thermal balance is not to be had on Venus, and that Sagan and his super greenhouse theory are FUBAR, but that that can't really be, that he and others are probably, hopefully looking at something the wrong way, but he doesn't know what that something is.</p>\n\n<p>John Ackerman, \"An Alternative View of Venus\" ...</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Thus independent measurements on five vehicles, one measuring the energy emitted into space from the cloud tops, and four measuring some component of the up-welling or net (upwelling minus down-dwelling) energy flux in the atmosphere at completely different geographic locations, are consistent and indicate that Venus is radiating an enormously larger amount of energy than it receives from the Sun. In spite of this data, the authors of every one of these papers deferred to the theoretical model of Pollack, suggesting that all five of the radiation instruments on which their analyses are based, might be in error -- even though there was no indication of problems in the calibration of data.</em></p>\n\n<p>_Based strictly on a thermodynamic analysis of the Pioneer Venus radiation data another group stated that neither the greenhouse effect nor global dynamics can explain the net outflow of energy, and that an internal source on Venus must be responsible for the emanating some 250 times the flux radiated by the Earth. <em>Unfortunately, these authors also defer to the Pollack model, suggesting the possibility of instrumental error or that perhaps two of the three small probe sites are atypical of the planet as a whole.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>L.G. Young, \"Infrared Spectra of Venus,\" Exploration of the Planetary System (Boston 1974), p.139</p>\n\n<p><em>\"some theoreticians have dismissed perfectly good observations under the assumption that the data were 'noisy' because conditions on Venus appeared to vary on a short time scale, a situation that could not occur in their models ...</em></p>\n\n<p>_<em>There has been a profusion of crude, oversimplified models which have 'explained' discrepancies between theory and observation as due to effects not included in the theory. Thus there has been a tendency to claim 'agreement' with the observations prematurely. Finally, not only have wrong interpretations of the data been widely accepted at various times, but some correct interpretations have been rejected for long periods of time. What interpretation is 'acceptable' has been colored by prejudices (Venus is/isn't like the Earth, the curve of growth does/doesn't apply to a scattering atmosphere, etc.) so that major questions appear to have been decided more on emotional than on rational grounds.\"</em>_</p>\n\n<p>By 2002, these corrections to the dataset were completely forgotten about.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Shermer's <em>The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience</em> ironically and definitively states:</p>\n\n<p>_<em>\"But there was no excess of energy radiated from the planet</em> (since the thick atmosphere effectively contained the high surface temperature).  <em>The total radiated energy was in balance with absorbed sunlight,</em> and it did not decline over time.  Further, the high surface temperature had an alternative explanation from an atmospheric greenhouse effect.\"_</p>\n\n<p>The Thermal Balance of the Atmosphere of Venus, Tomasko, Boese, Ingersoll, Lacis, Limaye, Seiff, Stewart, Taylor</p>\n\n<p><em>\"In a purely radiative-convective equilibrium model the thermal flux carried outward by the model will not be constant but will equal the net inward solar flux at each level. What is needed is therefore the profile of broad-band (0.3 to 3 micron) net (downward minus upward) solar flux at each level in the atmosphere.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Venus Express: Results of the Nominal Mission</em> by the AGU</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Some of the main objectives for Venus were determination of the temperature field in the altitude range 55–100 km, both on the nightside and on the dayside, mapping of the surface temperature, and making profiles of the abundance of a large number of gases in the middle and lower atmosphere. It was also to measure the outgoing thermal flux to determine the global radiation budget. Unfortunately, a mechanism that controls the mirror that switches the beam between the different calibration targets and the view toward the planet is stuck in its launch position, pointing toward a blackbody target. In spite of many attempts it has not been possible to move the scanner since the launch.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"venus-and-the-cosmic-connection","quoteName":"Venus and the Cosmic Connection","keyword":"venus cosmic connection","quoteParagraph":"<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=XPms57v-_w0C&amp;pg=PT125&amp;lpg=PT125&amp;dq=venus+greek+newcomer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RY7zuDc5t7&amp;sig=CyGlEmxBEA52Thp1yrrVfChkMF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi315uSw4XRAhVS9mMKHRQ2Bzo4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">https://books.google.com/books?id=XPms57v-_w0C&amp;pg=PT125&amp;lpg=PT125&amp;dq=venus+greek+newcomer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RY7zuDc5t7&amp;sig=CyGlEmxBEA52Thp1yrrVfChkMF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi315uSw4XRAhVS9mMKHRQ2Bzo4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p>\n\n<p>Venus and the Cosmic Connection</p>\n\n<p>\"Repeatedly, these calamities were attributed to a malicious deity almost invariably a goddess coming to wreak havoc upon the Earth. Although the actual names naturally varied, the deity involved turned out time and time again to be the one that cultures worldwide associated with the object we know today as the planet Venus. But they didn't talk about it as if it were a planet -- they described it as a comet. A Chinese text describes Venus as spanning the heavens, rivaling the Sun in brightness. Mexican astronomers referred to it as 'the star that smokes,' while on the opposite side of the world the same theme is found in the Hindu Vedas, the Hebrew Talmud, and the Egyptian description of Sekhmet. The Aztecs called Venus the 'heart' of Quetzlcoatl, which in turn means 'plumed serpent,' with feathers that signify fire. The serpent or dragon is one of the most common figures used in the ancient world to signify 'comet,' examples being the Greek Typhon, Egyptian Set, Babylonian Tiamat, Hindu Vrta, all of whom raged across the sky and brought destruction upon the world.</p>\n\n<p>The word 'comet' comes from the Greek coma, meaning hair, and among ancient astronomers referred to a star with hair, or a beard. The same appellation was given to Venus. One of the Mexican names for Venus was 'the mane' -- the Peruvian name, chaska, means 'wavy-haired'; the Arabs call Venus 'the one with hair.' One of the most vivid comet images is the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, recognized universally as representing Venus. Ishtar is described as being 'the bright torch of heaven,' 'clothed in fire,' and the 'fearful dragon,' while her heavenly manifestation is known as the 'bearded star.'\"</p>"},{"id":"why-controversies-matter","quoteName":"Why Controversies Matter","keyword":"why controversies matter","quoteParagraph":"<p>From the Preface to The Golem - What You Should Know About Science</p>\n\n<p>\"One reviewer argues: 'it is quite easy to think of political decisions with a scientific side to them where the science is noncontroversial' and offers as an example the effect on medical institutions of the development of a predictive test for Huntington's disease. But if the science is non-controversial, why do those running the medical institutions need to understand the deep nature of the science that gave rise to the results? If the test is uncontroversially valid they can make their decisions without understanding how agreement about the test was reached. Thus, while thanking our reviewers for the many generous comments about the importance, the informativeness, and the style of the book, we stand by our claim that 'For citizens who want to take part in the democratic processes of a technological society, all the science they need to know about is controversial...'\"</p>\n\n<p>From the Conclusion to The Golem - What You Should Know About Science</p>\n\n<p>Science and the citizen</p>\n\n<p>\"The debate about the public understanding of science is equally confounded by confusion over method and content. What should be explained is methods of science, but what most people concerned with the issues want the public to know about is the truth about the natural world -- that is, what the powerful believe to be the truth about the natural world. The laudable reason for concern with public understanding is that scientific and technological issues figure more and more in the political process. Citizens, when they vote, need to know enough to come to some decision about whether they prefer more coal mines or more nuclear power stations, more corn or clearer rivers, more tortured animals or more healthy children, or whether these really are the choices. Perhaps there are novel solutions: wave power, organic farming, drug testing without torture. The 'public understanders', as we might call them, seem to think that if the person in the street knows more science -- as opposed to more about science -- they will be able to make more sensible decisions about these things.</p>\n\n<p>How strange that they should think this; it ranks among the great fallacies of our age. Why? -- because PhDs and professors are found on all sides in these debates. The arguments have largely been invented in universities. Thus, all sides have expertise way beyond what can ever be hoped of the person in the street, and all sides know how to argue their case clearly and without obvious fallacies. Why such debates are unresolvable, in spite of all this expertise, is what we have tried to show in the descriptive chapters of this book. That is, we have shown that scientists at the research front cannot settle their deep disagreements through better experimentation, more knowledge, more advanced theories, or clearer thinking ...</p>\n\n<p>We agree with the public understanders that the citizen needs to be informed enough to vote on technical issues, but the information needed is not about the content of science; it is about the relationship of experts to politicians, to the media, and to the rest of us. The citizen has great experience in the matter of how to cope with divided expertise -- isn't this what party politics is? What the citizen cannot do is cope with divided expertise pretending to be something else. Instead of one question -- 'Who to believe?' -- there are two questions -- 'Who to believe?' and 'Are scientists and technologists Gods or charlatans?'. The second question is what makes the whole debate so unstable ...\"</p>"}]
